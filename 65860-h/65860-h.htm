<p class="center">THE STORY OF ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA</p>
<p class="center">With twelve illustrations in half-tone, and frontispiece in colours.</p>
<p class="center">2/6 net.</p>
<p>Miss Syrett writes with a remarkable freshness and
deftness of touch which will appeal to readers of all
ages, but especially to the young reader. For the
story as she tells it has the colour and joy of a fairy
tale&mdash;and yet is true; and the delicate reserve
shown in dealing with the religious side of the
narrative adds to its impressiveness.</p>

<h2><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>In the hope of bringing the actual presentment of
Mediaeval Miracle Plays more vividly before the minds
of children, I have cast information concerning them
into the form of a story. But, while this method of
dealing with the plays may prove to the childish reader
more interesting and palatable than a mere summary
of what is known concerning them, it leads to certain
liberties difficult to avoid in fiction.</p>
<p>It seemed, to take an example, in some ways more
convenient to lay the scene of the little story in York.
Yet many of the Wakefield and Coventry plays lend
themselves to description better than those of the
York series. However, when in the course of the
tale I have made use of an alien play, I have taken
care to mention the fact, and to invent a reason
(plausible enough, I trust, in a story) for its performance
at York.</p>
<p>Again, the stage directions for some of these old
plays are so vague that the precise manner of their
presentment must be left to individual imagination
and common sense. In a story there is no room for
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
tentative speculations, nor for suggested alternative
treatments; and this being the case, I trust I may be
forgiven if occasionally I handle my material over-confidently.
This explanation is offered to older
students, to whom, simple as it is, my little summary,
compiled from the recognized authorities on the subject
of miracle plays, may yet be of some value.
In writing it I found most helpful and delightful
Mr. Sidney W. Clarke&rsquo;s book, <i>The Miracle Play in
England</i>, and, written by Mr. Ernest Rhys, the preface
to <i>Everyman</i>, in Everyman&rsquo;s Library. To both these
gentlemen my thanks are specially due.</p>

<br />INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Of all the delightful games which children play in
the nursery or in the schoolroom, perhaps the
favourite one is dressing-up, and acting. And of
all the Christmas treats, perhaps the best is going to
the theatre&mdash;either to the pantomime or to one of the
fairy plays which fortunate children can now enjoy.</p>
<p>There are grown-up people too who never get
tired of dressing-up and acting, nor of going to the
theatre to see other people act. It is a taste which
is shared by children and grown-up people alike.
And it has always been so. Long, long ago, when
all the people in the world were savage, there is no
doubt that little naked children picked up their
fathers&rsquo; spears, and bows and arrows (or made smaller
ones in imitation of them), and &ldquo;acted&rdquo; the hunting
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of animals or the killing of enemies, while their
parents looked on, pleased and interested by the
performance.</p>
<p>Thousands of years have passed since the first
&ldquo;acting&rdquo; took place on some lonely beach, perhaps,
or in a clearing of the forest where savage children
played; and now in all our big towns we have big
houses specially built for acting, and there are many
men and women who spend most of their time either
in writing plays or in learning and acting them.</p>
<p>Every evening in London hundreds of cabs and
motor-cars stop before some brilliantly lighted theatre
to set down people who have come to see one of the
many plays performed night after night in this great
city. And seven hundred years ago people also
crowded to see plays in London, though it was a very
different London then, and a very different building
at which they arrived.</p>
<p>Instead of ladies in evening gowns, and gentlemen
all dressed alike in black coats, stepping out of cabs
and motor-cars to walk across a pavement to the
theatre door, you would have seen, on certain days
long ago, a curiously dressed crowd of men, women,
and children, some on horseback, some on foot, all
pressing in one direction. There would be barefooted
monks, soldiers with breastplates and helmets
of steel, nuns with white caps and veils, little boys
with long stockings, one red, one green perhaps, and
short tunics belted at the waist; ladies with full
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
flowing robes and strange head-dresses, some pointed
like a sugar-loaf, some with veils arranged over a
frame in the shape of two horns. And all these
people in their quaint and varying costumes would
be threading their way through narrow, dirty streets,
like lanes, between overhanging houses, till they
stopped&mdash;not before a big lighted house with playbills
outside, and a marble hall and gilded ceiling
with doors leading to the theatre within&mdash;but in front
of the great gates of a church, and that church might
have been Westminster Abbey. For there the play
they had come to see was to be performed!</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem to us now, the first theatres
in England were the churches, and, as you may guess,
the first plays to be acted were religious plays.</p>
<p>Let us try to understand the reason for this.
You remember that William I conquered England
in 1066&mdash;eight hundred years ago. Well, from the
time that he and his followers came to this country
the English race has been gradually growing into the
nation to which we belong and into the sort of people
we see round us every day. Even the very poorest
English children nowadays go to school and can read
and write. Children whose parents are not so poor
learn much besides reading and writing, and thousands
of the sons and daughters of rich or fairly well-to-do
people go to college, and spend years of their life
in study. So that now, in the twentieth century,
English people are on the whole <i>educated</i>. But it
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
has taken a very long time to arrive at such a state
of things as this, and for hundreds of years after the
Conquest, not only the poor, but even the richer and
quite rich people were ignorant. Very few men
except those who belonged to the Church studied at
all. Thousands of the rest could neither read nor
write.</p>
<p>Now very naturally the Church considered that
<i>religion</i> at least must in some way be taught and
explained to these masses of ignorant folk. Whatever
else they knew, or did not know, it was necessary
that they should understand the faith they
professed. They called themselves Christians, yet
how were people who could not read, to learn even
the Bible stories, or anything at all about the teaching
of <span class="sc">Christ</span>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might go to the churches,&rdquo; you will say,
perhaps, &ldquo;where the Bible would be read to them by
the priests.&rdquo; But <i>that</i> would not do. For remember
that for hundreds of years after the Conquest the
service was always read in Latin, a language which
very few people except lawyers, priests, and scholars
understood. No doubt, so far as they could, the
clergy privately explained the teaching of the Church
to as many people as they could reach. But thousands
and thousands of them were never reached
privately at all. They just came to church on
Sundays and on Saints&rsquo; days, and went away without
any real knowledge of what the services meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>It was a difficult problem, yet the monks and clergy
conquered it. They thought of a way of teaching
for which no books were necessary. A way moreover,
by which hundreds of people could learn at the
same time, merely by using their eyes and their ears.
The life of <span class="sc">Christ</span>, the lives of the Saints, the whole
Bible history, they discovered, could be <i>shown</i> to the
people in the form of plays or acted stories. The
clergy should write the plays, they agreed, and the
clergy themselves should act them!</p>
<p>It was a clever idea, cleverly carried out. In
various monasteries monks began to write and to
arrange such plays, to be acted in the churches on
special days, at special pauses in the service.</p>
<p>At first the religious scenes they prepared were
very simple, and performed chiefly in dumb show.</p>
<p>We know, for instance, of one little play that was
acted about eight hundred years ago in a church
dedicated to S. Nicholas.</p>
<p>Now the priests of that church were naturally
anxious for the people in their charge to know as
much as possible about the saint&mdash;their own special
saint, whose name they mentioned every time they
spoke of the church.</p>
<p>On the feast day of S. Nicholas therefore, before
the service began, they removed from its niche the
stone image of the saint, and in its place a priest
stood, dressed as much like the statue as possible.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the story. The rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
had to be explained by acting. Not only was
S. Nicholas the special saint of children, he was
also the protector of travellers, and the play was
meant to show how powerful he was in this respect,
and what miracles he could work for those who put
their trust in him.</p>
<p>The usual service was begun, and then, at a stated
time, a pause was made. The church doors were
thrown open, and a priest dressed as a traveller from
a distant land, came in and bowed before the shrine
of S. Nicholas. The priest represented a heathen
who had heard of the saint&rsquo;s power, and wanted to
discover whether all he had been told was true. His
flowing robes and his jewelled turban showed the
audience that he came from a foreign land, and was
not a Christian. Presently, from the folds of his
robe, this man took a rich treasure, and placing it at
the feet of the saint, told him that he was going on
a journey, and prayed him to guard the wealth he
left in his keeping. Then he went his way out of
the church.</p>
<p>But no sooner had he departed, than other priests
dressed as robbers, crept in, and stealing up to the
shrine, took the treasure and hurried away with their
booty. Meanwhile, the heathen, who felt uneasy
about leaving his wealth in the saint&rsquo;s care, returned
to make quite sure of its safety and finding the
treasure gone, began to storm and rave. He was
proceeding to beat and insult the image, when to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
his amazement it moved! Stepping down from the
niche, it went out to seek the robbers who were
hidden just outside the church. So terrified were
they at the approach of a living saint when as they
thought, only a statue had watched their theft, that
they immediately restored the treasure, and tremblingly
followed S. Nicholas into the church. The
heathen, overjoyed and full of awe and wonder, fell
at the saint&rsquo;s feet. Then S. Nicholas bade him
become a Christian, and worship the true <span class="sc">God</span>.</p>
<p>So the play ended, and the interrupted service
went on.</p>
<p>Simple as it was, the little scene no doubt persuaded
the congregation that S. Nicholas was a great
and powerful personage, and the impression it made
upon them was one they were not likely to forget,
because of the strange and interesting manner in
which the lesson was taught.</p>
<p>This is the first play we know anything about,
but we may guess that others more or less like
it, began to be very popular, for we find from
old books&mdash;books written hundreds of years ago,
that twice a year at least, at Christmas and at Easter,
the people were taught by means of acting, two of
the greatest events in the life of <span class="sc">Christ</span>.</p>
<p>Let us try to imagine a Christmas Eve in Westminster
Abbey, long ago, when Henry III was king.
The Abbey was not nearly so large then as it is
to-day, for much of it has been built since. Yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the central part was finished, and six hundred years
ago people looked up at some of the same soaring
arches, and leant against some of the same pillars as
those we now see in the beautiful church.</p>
<p>The Abbey bells had been ringing for a long
time, calling the Londoners from their homes, and
from the crooked narrow lanes of the city, through
the gates in the walls which then surrounded Westminster,
there had come flocking to the church a
great crowd of gentle and simple folk. There were
merchants and shopkeepers, wearing hoods like jelly-bags
with their long points dangling at the back;
ladies with strange fantastic head-dresses; poor
women and children muffled in cloaks; soldiers,
nobles, and monks of various orders. Some of
them stood thronging the aisles, others knelt on
stools, or beside wooden benches.</p>
<p>The church was dark and mysterious. Only on
the altars, candles blazed like golden stars, and above
them the arches rose stretching up into the gloom
overhead. The air was full of a sweet heavy scent&mdash;the
scent of incense.</p>
<p>Near the altar, surrounded by gleaming lights, the
people could see a rough cradle shaped like a manger,
and beside it, dressed in long robes, an image of the
Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Then from the side-doors leading to the space about
the altar, there entered, in twos and threes, men dressed
as shepherds, holding crooks, and driving before them
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
real sheep. They were followed by dogs, who kept
the flock together, running round them, and ordering
them in the wonderful way of sheep-dogs. Some
of the shepherds lay down as though to sleep. Others
watched their flock, wide awake and talking amongst
themselves.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while interested and curious the congregation
looked on, a blast of trumpets rang out, and
before the startling sound had died away, echoing
through the aisles and the arches, an angel in a robe of
rose colour, with big white wings, appeared in the
pulpit. Very sweet and clear his voice sounded as he
announced tidings of great joy. <i>Christ was born in
Bethlehem.</i></p>
<p>Then, somewhere from the darkness above, there
followed, in a burst of song, the voices of the
angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to <span class="sc">God</span> in the highest,&rdquo; they sang, &ldquo;and on
earth, peace, good will toward men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can you not imagine how the children gazed up
through the gloom, expecting to see the white-winged
angels hovering down towards them? And though
the grown-up people knew that the music came from
the singing boys placed in a gallery high up over the
windows, they too must have felt that the message was
a heavenly one, and many of them were filled with awe.
And now, when the beautiful voices were silent, the
shepherds began to crowd towards the altar. There,
kneeling before the manger, they adored the Baby and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
His Mother, and afterwards, walking in procession
through the church, past the watching crowd, they
sang a hymn of praise.</p>
<p>This was the scene which in numberless churches all
over England took place six hundred years ago on
Christmas Eve, and even now a memory of it dwells
at Christmas-time in many churches.</p>
<p>Nearly every church in Roman Catholic countries
gives up one of its little chapels to a representation of
the stable at Bethlehem. The actors are no longer
real, but figures of Joseph and Mary and the shepherds
take their place.</p>
<p>In Italy, the Christmas &ldquo;manger scene&rdquo; in the
churches is often very elaborate. I remember one
in a church just outside Florence, before which
there was always a crowd of little children staring in
delight. The whole of a tiny chapel was turned into
a sort of cave or grotto, with winding paths from the
heights, down which came figures to represent the
Wise Men from the East, with toy camels and leopards
following them. In the midst of the grotto there was
a straw-filled manger, and in it lay the Baby <span class="sc">Jesus</span>.
The Virgin Mary with clasped hands knelt beside
it, and Joseph, leaning on his staff, looked over her
shoulder at the Child. A group of shepherds with
crooks knelt near the Holy Family, while their woolly
toy flocks were huddled round them.</p>
<p>At Easter-time also, six hundred years ago, the
people in England were taught by means of acting that
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
<i>Easter</i> means the Resurrection of <span class="sc">Christ</span> from the
dead.</p>
<p>Before the altar, a grave was prepared, and at a
certain part of the service, choristers, representing the
women who went to the sepulchre, walked up the
aisle, bearing the spices and the ointments. When
they arrived at the grave, they found seated beside it
an angel, who said, &ldquo;Why seek ye the living among
the dead? He is not here, but is risen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the story as it is told in the Bible went on,
acted by the clergy, till one of them, representing
<span class="sc">Christ</span> Himself, appeared to the rest, announcing that
He had risen from the grave. At this point the whole
choir burst into songs of &ldquo;Alleluia,&rdquo; and the play
ended.</p>
<p>Like the &ldquo;manger scene,&rdquo; a memory of this old
play persists in some religious customs which still
linger. In Italy, if you go to any of the churches just
before Easter, you will see in front of one of the altars
something that looks like a little garden of flowers.
There are tubs of blossoming shrubs; masses of tulips
and daffodils and anemones, some in pots, some in jars
of water, and amongst the flowers you will find, cut in
wood perhaps, and painted to look as real as possible,
the spear, the nails, the cross&mdash;all the terrible things
that were used at the Crucifixion. And this little
&ldquo;arranged&rdquo; plot of colour and scent is called <i>The
Sepulchre</i>. The Easter play is acted no more, but it is
a beautiful thought to make a <i>garden</i> in memory of it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
to show that death is conquered. For the &ldquo;sepulchre&rdquo;
holds not death, but life&mdash;the lovely life of flowers.</p>
<p>This, you see, is another way of teaching people the
meaning of the Resurrection.</p>
<p class="tb">The first plays, then, were religious plays, and they
were acted in churches. But soon they grew so
popular, and so many people crowded to see them,
that the churches were not large enough to contain the
throng, and by degrees the custom grew up of acting
them <i>outside</i> the church, so that they might be seen by
a much larger audience than the building itself could
hold.</p>
<p>From a very old play in which stage directions are
given, we are able to understand how the performance
was arranged. The story of this play is The
Disobedience of Eve, and the loss of Paradise through
her sin.</p>
<p>Just below one of the windows of the church,
supported by scaffolding, a platform was put up.
From this platform, steps led to a lower stage, and
there was a space between this under platform and the
ground.</p>
<p>Thus the church itself stood for Heaven. The
first platform was Paradise, the second Earth, and the
space beneath it, Hell. So that when <span class="sc">God</span> the <span class="sc">Father</span>
descended from Heaven to walk in the garden of
Paradise &ldquo;in the cool of the day,&rdquo; the priest who
represented Him, came from the church window to
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; platform. And when Adam and Eve,
having tasted of the fruit, were driven out of the
garden, they descended the steps to the &ldquo;Earth&rdquo;
stage, and at last to the space below which meant Hell,
where in the midst of clouds of smoke, and with great
rattling of chains, boys dressed as demons lay in
wait for them.</p>
<p>A play such as this must have been a quaint and
curious sight, and to us who live so many years after
the people who gazed at it from some churchyard
long ago, it seems childish and even occasionally
horrible. But we are in many ways unlike those
homely folk who used to stand open-mouthed in
amazement before such a scene. We have read many
books, and our ideas about religion have changed
so much that it is difficult to imagine how greatly
acting, even of this sort, must have impressed the
simple minds of men and women who had read
nothing, and were often full of fears and superstitions.
They were like little children who have to be taught
in a way that will fix and hold their attention. Just as
a tiny boy or girl is taught its letters with bright and
highly coloured picture-blocks.</p>
<p>So far we have seen how these religious plays were at
first acted in churches, then came to be performed
outside them. Now we shall discover that a further
change was presently to be made. As the years passed,
people began to expect more and more in the way of
acting. They wanted richer dresses for the players,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
more scenery, and bigger spaces for the performances.
Far from getting tired of these theatrical performances,
the taste for them grew, and greater and still greater
throngs pressed towards the churchyards every time a
play was announced. You will understand how disorder
arose, and spread. Rough crowds spoilt the
grass in the churchyards, and trampled upon the
graves, for the plays began to be looked upon as
amusements for a holiday, rather than as religious
ceremonies to be watched quietly and with reverence.
So in time it was felt that a churchyard was not a
fit place for a boisterous throng. It was too near the
sacred building, which the people profaned with their
noise.</p>
<p>Yet if the plays were removed from the surroundings
of the church, it no longer seemed fitting that
priests should take part in them. Thus it happened
that by the end of the thirteenth century, about the
time when Edward I was king, the clergy had left off
acting, except at Christmas-time and at Easter, when,
as usual, the Nativity scene, and the scene of the
Resurrection were performed in the churches. Every
other sort of religious play was henceforward acted by
the <i>laity</i> (that is, by people who, whatever they may be
by trade or profession, are not clergy). So a class of
men grew up who were paid for acting, and often
gained their living in this way alone; and though the
plays they acted were still religious plays, the cost
of them was borne by rich people, and they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
by degrees made into grand performances, as we
shall see.</p>
<p>All through those years which are known as the
Middle Ages it was the custom for men who belonged
to the same trade to form themselves into a society,
or <i>guild</i> as it was called, to protect and help one
another in their own particular work. Each trade had
its own guild, and its own special saint as guardian.
There was the Tanners&rsquo; Guild, the Fishmongers&rsquo;, the
Carpenters&rsquo;, the Armourers&rsquo;, the Bakers&rsquo;, and so forth&mdash;too
many of them to mention. Now many of these
guilds in the course of time had become very rich
societies, and could afford to spend a great deal of
money upon anything that interested them. Plays
interested all the townsfolk immensely, and so even
before the clergy had quite left off acting in them,
the guilds began to take the management of these
plays into their charge, paying the actors, providing
rich and costly dresses, such scenery as could in those
days be made, and everything in fact that is known as
&ldquo;stage property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests still <i>wrote</i> the stories, but the acting and
the whole management of them passed into the care of
the rich guilds.</p>
<p><i>Miracle plays</i> was the name given to these religious
&ldquo;acted stories,&rdquo; and very fortunately, four sets of
Miracle plays have been found and preserved, so that
we can read the very words spoken by actors long ago
to audiences of eager and interested people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>These four sets are the York, Wakefield, Chester,
and Coventry plays. Each &ldquo;set&rdquo; includes a great
many plays&mdash;in the York collection, for instance, there
are forty-eight&mdash;and year after year from the reign of
Edward III to the time of Henry VII they were acted
at the four towns mentioned. Not in these towns
alone either, but all over England; for if a city had no
plays of its own it borrowed one of the York, Chester,
Wakefield, or Coventry set.</p>
<p>If we look at the York collection of Miracle plays,
it will do as an example of the rest. We find that it
begins with the <i>Story of the Creation of the World</i>, and
all the chief stories of the Old and New Testament
follow in proper order. So that, even if he could not
read, any one who saw the whole series one after the
other, would have a very good idea of all the teaching
of the Bible.</p>
<p>Now let us in thought go back to the Middle Ages,
and try to picture the scene in some old market-place,
soon after Whitsuntide, the time when Miracle plays
were generally acted. To help us to do this, let us
imagine how the sight of them impressed two out
of the thousands of children who with their parents
went to see these plays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">How Colin and Margery kept the Feast of Corpus Christi</span></h2>
<p>Colin and Margery were two children who, five
hundred years ago, lived in the country, not far
from York. Their father, who had a little farm,
held his land from the great lord whose castle with
its battlements and turrets stood up proudly on a
neighbouring hill, and sometimes the children had
seen him when, with a great company of followers,
he went hawking, and rode past their cottage.</p>
<p>Now, except for the Lady Alicia, her young children,
and a few retainers, the castle stood empty. Its lord,
with all his men-at-arms, had gone to fight in the wars
with France, for Henry V was king, and, not content
with ruling England, he wanted to be King of France
as well.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s father, Farmer Short, was not rich,
but neither was he very poor. The cottage in which
he lived with his wife and his little son and daughter
was in those days considered comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>It was built of stone, had low walls and a thatched
roof, and the kitchen, in which Colin and Margery
slept, was paved with stone, and had a wooden ceiling,
which Farmer Short could easily touch with his hand.</p>
<p>Neither Colin nor Margery went to school. There
was no school nearer than York, some miles distant;
and though Margery was nine and Colin ten, they did
not even know their letters, and all their lives they
never learnt to read. But without going to school
there was plenty to do all day long. Colin had to
look after the cows and to help his father in the fields;
and every morning, besides learning to help her mother
in the house, Margery was sent out on to the common
to watch the geese, and to drive them back if they
strayed too far.</p>
<p>One June evening both the children went to bed
in a state of great excitement. The next day was the
Feast of Corpus Christi&mdash;a festival in honour of the
<span class="sc">Lord&rsquo;s</span> Supper&mdash;and with their father and mother
they were to ride into York to see the Miracle plays.
The last time they were in church they had smiled at
one another when they found it was Trinity Sunday,
because they knew that Corpus Christi would come on
the following Thursday, four days later. Now the
great day was close at hand, and, though they lay down
on the little sacks of straw which served them for
beds, it was a long time before either of them slept.
Colin had once seen the plays, and his sister kept
asking him questions about them. What were they
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
like? What did the people do? What did they say?
But Colin&rsquo;s explanations did not satisfy her. He
remembered a big man dressed in bright clothes, who
stamped and made a great noise, and had a sword.
He told her about angels with great white wings, and
something also about people with black faces and
feathers and claws. But Margery was very little the
wiser; and presently, when she found her brother&rsquo;s
voice growing drowsier and drowsier, she too curled
round on her straw bed and went to sleep.</p>
<p>It was light when she awoke, though the sun had
not yet risen; and, jumping up, she shook Colin, who
directly he could be made to understand that the day
had come, also leaped from his bed and began to
struggle with the great bars of the kitchen-door. Just
as he managed to undo them and to throw open the
door to make quite certain that the morning was fine,
his mother, Mistress Short, came clattering down the
steps that led from the upper room right into the
kitchen.</p>
<p>She wore all her best things. A gown of grey
material was looped high over a girdle to show her
red stockings and her buckled shoes. On her head
there was a white cap, indented over the forehead, and
rising into two wings on either side, while folds of
linen were brought round her neck under her chin.
Over her arm she carried the children&rsquo;s holiday clothes,
for this was a great occasion. The whole family was
to spend the day at the house of her husband&rsquo;s sister,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Mistress Harpham, a rich glover&rsquo;s wife in York, and
Mistress Short was determined to make a good
appearance.</p>
<p>Colin and Margery were soon dressed, and if no
idea of much washing occurred to them, you must
remember that they lived hundreds of years ago, when
soap and water were not considered so necessary as
they are now. They dipped their heads indeed, into
a trough of water in the farmyard just outside, and
rubbing their faces with a cloth, were ready to have
the finishing-touches put to their clothes. In his
long stockings and little brown tunic, Colin looked
quite charming, and Margery was very proud of her
green frock looped up over a girdle like her mother&rsquo;s.
Both children wore little capes of linen, to which
a hood was attached, to be buttoned under the chin
or left hanging, according to the state of the weather.</p>
<p>Their mother had prepared a meal of cakes and ale,
but they were almost too excited to eat and drink, and
it was not till their father, who had gone to fetch the
horses, appeared, riding on Dobbin and leading Jock,
that they could believe they were really going to start.</p>
<p>Margery was soon seated in front of her father on
Dobbin&rsquo;s broad saddle, and Colin rode with his mother
on Jock, the other farm-horse; and so, long before
the sun rose, they ambled out of the yard into a lane
which led to the high road to York.</p>
<p>The sky was clear, the larks were singing, and the
wild roses in the hedges were all wet with dew, as they
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
rode under the arching trees. Soon, however, they
turned into the long white road, where already groups
of people, some on foot, some on horseback, others
in wooden carts, were wending their way to the city,
whose walls and gates could be seen in the distance.</p>
<p>Before long they were joined by several friends, and
a company of ten or twelve jogged along together,
discussing the probable events of the day.</p>
<p>You might find it difficult to understand their
conversation if you could hear it now, for though
these country people of course spoke English, it was
not the English of to-day. Though many of the
words were those we know well, there were others which
have since fallen out of use, or are pronounced differently;
so if I put their talk into the language to
which we are accustomed, you must remember that
though the sense of it is the same, it was not spoken
in just this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts does the first play begin?&rdquo; asked
Farmer Short, who had not been to the city for
a whole year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the gates of the priory in Mikelgate,&rdquo; said
the man who rode next to him.</p>
<p>Master Brigg was a townsman on a visit to his
country relations, with whom he was journeying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next, at the door of Robert Harpham,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;Then at Skeldergate End. After that, I don&rsquo;t
know. I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin pricked up his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t have to wait long,&rdquo; he whispered,
leaning across to Margery. &ldquo;Aunt Harpham lives
close to Mikelgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who plays the <i>Creation</i> this year?&rdquo; his father
was asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Plasterers,&rdquo; replied Master Brigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>Adam and Eve</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I forget. But the Glovers have charge of
<i>Cain and Abel</i>, and the Shipwrights this year are giving
<i>The Building of the Ark</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thought! &rsquo;Tis the best play for shipwrights!&rdquo;
declared the farmer, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
bound they&rsquo;ll see it built well and truly. What of
<i>The Shepherds&rsquo; Play</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chandlers have the care of that, and the
Goldsmiths of <i>The Coming of the Three Kings to Herod</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man I told you about,&rdquo; cried Colin.
&ldquo;The man that stamped, and talked loud, and had
a sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; interrupted Margery, excitedly. &ldquo;We
are coming quite close! We shall soon be there!&rdquo;
And indeed, while they talked, the little company had
drawn near to the city, whose walls and frowning
gates rose up before them. In a very few minutes
they had clattered under the archway of Petergate,
and the children found themselves in the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Creation of the Angels, and the Fall of Lucifer</span></h2>
<p>Margery, who had never been to any big town before,
looked about her with delight and amazement as they
rode towards the inn where Dobbin and Jock were to
be left in the stables till the evening. The narrow
streets were paved with cobble-stones, and lined with
houses which compared with the little cottage at home,
seemed to her marvellously grand and imposing. They
were built of plaster and timber, with gables curiously
carved, and as in many of them each story projected
beyond the lower one, the top windows on either side
of the streets were close together, so that opposite
neighbours were near enough to shake hands. There
was such a crowd that the horses had to walk very
slowly, pushing their way amongst the people. Early
as it still was, the whole city seemed to be awake and
astir, and the noise was deafening. Carts clattered
over the rough stones, their drivers shouting to the
throng to make way. Boys whistled and screamed,
whips cracked; mothers called to their children to
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
keep close, and the whole crowd seemed to be moving
in one direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to Mikelgate; that&rsquo;s where the
first play begins,&rdquo; called Colin, looking back over his
shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, father, make haste! We shall be
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty o&rsquo; time! plenty o&rsquo; time!&rdquo; declared Farmer
Short. &ldquo;Here we turn in, at the sign of the &lsquo;Dragon.&rsquo;
Pull Jock&rsquo;s head round, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had now reached an archway, and following a
procession of other horses and carts, they soon found
themselves in the big courtyard of the inn, which had
a wooden gallery upon which the living-rooms of the
first floor opened, running along three sides of it.
Above the gallery there was another story, surmounted
by gabled roofs, with carvings upon them of
curious birds and beasts and hobgoblins. The blue
sky formed the ceiling over the courtyard.</p>
<p>A stableman ran to lift Margery from Dobbin&rsquo;s
back, and then to help Mistress Short to dismount.
Colin had slipped from the saddle by himself, and his
father following him, went to see that the horses were
as comfortably lodged as possible, for there were so
many others that there was scarcely room for them all
in the stables.</p>
<p>The children waited impatiently till he reappeared,
for they were to go on foot to the house of Mistress
Harpham, near Mikelgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be late! I know we shall be late!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Margery kept repeating till her mother bade her be
quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take at least an hour for the first play to
reach the house of your Aunt Harpham,&rdquo; she assured
her. &ldquo;It has but just begun at Mikelgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Margery was not happy till, having pushed
their way out of the throng in the courtyard, they
found themselves on the way to their kinswoman&rsquo;s
dwelling.</p>
<p>Master Harpham&rsquo;s house appeared very grand to
the children. It had a big carved doorway leading to
the shop, and the rooms above seemed to them magnificently
furnished, with their big oak chests, and
their high-backed chairs with leather seats, and the
ornamented beams across the ceiling. Mistress Harpham,
a stout, rosy-faced dame, greeted them very
kindly, and called to her son to come and be introduced
to his little cousins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giles is going to act!&rdquo; she told them proudly.
&ldquo;But not yet. His turn comes later. He is to be
Isaac in the play of <i>Abraham&rsquo;s Sacrifice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin and Margery looked with awe and amazement
upon their cousin. He was a pretty boy of twelve,
with fair hair hanging to his shoulders, and a pale,
delicate little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be frightened?&rdquo; whispered Margery,
gazing at him with breathless interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not very,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;I have been
in the plays before. Last year I was an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take them to the window, Giles!&rdquo; called his
mother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were in our seats. Little
ones in the front; grown-ups at the back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was by this time full of townsfolk, invited
by the glover and his wife, and the first-floor windows,
as well as the upper ones, were crowded with people in
holiday dresses; the women in snowy wimples, and
gowns of many colours; the men in tunics of russet
brown or dull green.</p>
<p>Colin, Margery, and Giles sat on stools close to the
window, and the country children looked with interest
at the scene before them. The glover&rsquo;s house was at
the corner of the market-place, and the windows of all
the houses surrounding it were hung with gay cloths,
and packed from basement to roof with people.</p>
<p>Below, in the cobble-paved square, with a babel of
noise and confusion, the poorer folk crowded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any room when the play <i>does</i>
come!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heralds will clear the way,&rdquo; said Giles. &ldquo;Last
night it was such fun to watch them! They rode
through all the town reading the proclamation. That&rsquo;s
a warning, you know, for every one to behave properly
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what did they say?&rdquo; asked Margery, with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they came to the market-place here, on
horseback, with trumpets, and one man shouted at
the top of his voice. Let me see. What did he say?
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
I believe I can remember some of it. It was like this....
<i>Oyez. We command, on the King&rsquo;s behalf, and the
Mayor and the Sheriffs of this city, that no man go armed
in this city with swords nor Carlisle axes, nor none other
defences in disturbance of the King&rsquo;s peace and the play, or
hindering of the procession of Corpus Christi, and that they
leave their harness in their inns....</i> I forget the words
that came next, but they meant that each guild was to
act its play in proper order. And that all manner of
craftsmen who were responsible for a play should
employ &lsquo;good players well-arranged and openly speaking&rsquo;
upon pain of a fine. And all that sort of thing,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how you can remember it!&rdquo; said
Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, when you act, you have a great deal to learn
by heart, so you <i>must</i> have a good memory,&rdquo; returned
Giles, airily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look! look!&rdquo; interrupted Colin. &ldquo;Here
they come! These are the heralds, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stir and a swaying in the crowd, and all
the people at the windows began to crane their necks
to see three or four horsemen, who came riding down
a narrow side-alley into the market-place, scattering
the throng, which pressed back before them. Then a
silence fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how beautiful they look!&rdquo; Margery whispered.
And indeed in their tunics of blue and crimson,
embroidered with gold, their horses also decked in gay
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
velvet trappings, the heralds, with their silver trumpets,
were quite magnificent.</p>
<p>One of them, after a long blast on his trumpet, had
by this time begun to announce the plays.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Reverend lords and ladies all,</p>
<p class="t0">That at this time here assembled be,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he chanted, and then went on to mention the subject
of each play, and the special guild by which it was to
be acted.</p>
<p>The children exchanged delighted glances when the
Parchment-makers&rsquo; and Bookbinders&rsquo; Guild came in
its place on the list, for in that play, &ldquo;Abraham sacrificing
his son Isaac on an altar,&rdquo; they were, of course,
specially interested.</p>
<p>At last, with another blast from the trumpets, the
heralds clattered away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first pageant will be here in a minute,&rdquo; said
Giles. &ldquo;It must be nearly over at Mikelgate by this
time. The heralds were late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are all those flags for?&rdquo; asked Colin. He
was looking down into the market-place, where a great
square was marked out by gay banners stuck at intervals
into the ground between the cobble-stones. Each
banner had the arms of the city painted upon it, and
all the flags fluttered bravely in the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re to mark the place where the pageant is to
stand,&rdquo; said Giles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s arranged like that all over
the town. Wherever a platform is to be placed, the
banners are put to show the exact position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Giles telling you all about it?&rdquo; asked Master
Harpham, leaning over the shoulders of his friends at
the window to pat Margery&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Aye! aye!
You ask him anything you want to know, and I&rsquo;ll
warrant he&rsquo;ll have an answer ready. A fine fellow at
the pageants is Giles! The Town Council chose him
out of a score of others to play Isaac. Aye, that they
did!&rdquo; he added proudly, turning to the women who
crowded behind the children.</p>
<p>Margery looked up shyly at the big man, whom
they had not seen before. He had just come up from
his shop in the basement to bring the news that the
first platform, or <i>pageant</i>, as every one called it, was on
its way; and now he was passing from group to group
at the windows, greeting his acquaintances in a loud,
hearty voice, and inquiring whether every one could
see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have to practise a long time for Isaac?&rdquo;
asked Margery, who could not get over her awe at the
knowledge that Giles was one of the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so very long. We had about six rehearsals
at the Town Hall. But some of the people <i>were</i> such
a long time learning their parts!&rdquo; said Giles,
sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming! it&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; cried Colin; and
every one turned eagerly to the window.</p>
<p>Down below in the square there was a swaying
amongst the crowd, and a great murmur of expectation
as at the corner of the market-place, a huge object
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
came into view, towering high above the heads of the
people. It was preceded by a body of young men,
who pressed back the crowd with clubs or with the flat
sides of their swords, so as to clear the space marked
out by the banners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are all these people with clubs and swords?&rdquo;
inquired Colin excitedly, while Margery&rsquo;s eyes were
fixed on the swaying blue canvas that was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the apprentices of the guild&mdash;the Tanners&rsquo;
Guild, you know&rdquo;&mdash;Giles explained. &ldquo;The
apprentices of each guild have to keep the crowd in
order, and some of them have to drag the pageant
along. Here they come! That&rsquo;s Master Smith
pulling in front. We know him well. And there&rsquo;s
Robin Coke next to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The throng in the market-place was now well enough
ordered for the pageant to be clearly visible, and the
children saw a big wooden stage of two platforms, one
above the other.</p>
<p>It ran upon huge wheels, and in front there were
ropes, which were passed round the waists of eight or
ten men, who were pulling with all their might.</p>
<p>On it came, jolting over the cobble-stones of the
market-square till the men ceased to pull, and the
double platform stopped just in front of the window
at which the children sat.</p>
<p>The upper stage was just on a level with their eyes,
and Margery clasped her hands in delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the best place of all!&rdquo; she whispered
to her brother.</p>
<p>As yet the curtains of the upper platform were close
drawn, and she had time to look at the whole car
before the play actually began.</p>
<p>The lower half, she noticed, was all covered in by
brightly-coloured painted cloths, so that nothing of the
interior could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the players dress,&rdquo; Giles told her.
&ldquo;And there are trap-doors and steps leading from
it to the upper part, which is the stage, you know.
And&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the curtains were now pulled aside, disclosing
what seemed to the children a grand and beautiful
scene. A canopy, painted deep blue to represent the
sky, stretched above the head of an imposing figure
seated upon a gilt throne.</p>
<p>Those of you who have seen pictures of popes,
can imagine the dress of the player who represented
Almighty God. He wore a mitre upon his head, over
hair that was made stiff with gold. His beard was also
of stiff gold, and his robes were magnificently embroidered
and clasped with jewels. In his hand he held a
jewelled sceptre. The floor at his feet was strewn with
rushes, and at first there was nothing on the stage but
this stately figure, over-arched by the blue sky.</p>
<p>Then he spoke, chanting in a grave full voice, so
that the sound of it reached over the market-place;
and these were his words, put into the kind of English
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
we speak to-day. Below on this page you will find
them as they were then written.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am gracious and great, <span class="sc">God</span> without beginning;</p>
<p class="t0">I am maker unmade, all might is in me;</p>
<p class="t0">I am life and way unto salvation winning;</p>
<p class="t0">I am foremost and first; as I bid shall it be.</p>
<p class="t0">My blessing of face shall be blinding,</p>
<p class="t0">And descending from harm to be hiding,</p>
<p class="t0">My body in bliss ever abiding,</p>
<p class="t0">Unending without any ending.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;I am gracyus and grete, <span class="sc">God</span> without you begynning;</p>
<p class="t2">I am maker unmade, all mighte es in me;</p>
<p class="t2">I am lyfe and way unto welth wynnyng;</p>
<p class="t2">I am foremaste and fyrste, als I bid sall it be.</p>
<p class="t2">My blyssing of ble sall be blending,</p>
<p class="t2">And held and fro harme to be hydande,</p>
<p class="t2">My body in blys ay abydande,</p>
<p class="t2">Une dande withouten any endyng.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, with other grave words, the <span class="sc">Lord</span> began the
work of Creation. First He brought into existence
the angels, summoning them in nine orders of rank
and power, each order greater and more powerful than
the last. One after another they appeared from a
platform at the back of the stage, wearing coats of
gilded skin, over which long robes hung to their feet.
Golden wings were fastened to their shoulders, and on
their foreheads diadems sparkled.</p>
<p>Then, greatest of all, and more beautiful and
resplendent than the rest, came Lucifer.</p>
<p>On him the Almighty conferred dignity and honour
above all the other spirits He had created. He was
the Star of the Morning, the great and splendid archangel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>But Lucifer, filled with pride, soon began to contend
before <span class="sc">God</span>. He claimed still higher powers
than those which had been granted him, trying to
make himself the equal of the Almighty.</p>
<p>Then at last <span class="sc">God</span> spoke his sentence of banishment,
and he and the angels who worshipped him, were cast
down from heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O Lucifer, Star of the Morning, how art thou
fallen!</i>&rdquo; is a beautiful line in the Bible, which alludes
to the disgrace and banishment which the audience
now saw acted before their eyes.</p>
<p>Shortly after the fall of Lucifer, the curtains of the
pageant closed upon the scene of <span class="sc">God</span> enthroned,
surrounded by the good angels singing their praises to
the one and only deity.</p>
<p>Margery, who had looked and listened in amazed
delight, drew a long breath when this first play was
over. Colin, no less excited, began at once to talk
and to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! they are dragging the stage away!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the man you called Robin Coke,
and there&rsquo;s Master Smith, pulling with all his might.
Where are they going to take it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In front of John Gyseburn&rsquo;s door; that&rsquo;s where
it&rsquo;s played next,&rdquo; said Giles. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his son,
Matthew Gyseburn, the lawyer,&rdquo; he added, pointing
out a man who stood at the other window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; called Margery. &ldquo;Here comes another
pageant. What is this, Giles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still the <i>Creation</i>. The earth is made now, and
the birds and fishes and all the animals. This is the
Plasterers&rsquo; pageant. Yesterday John Wiseman showed
me all the pigeons he had got for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigeons?&rdquo; echoed Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Giles, nodding. &ldquo;I wonder
whether I ought to go?&rdquo; he added, looking back
anxiously at his mother. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be doing the third
play now at Mikelgate, as the second one has just
reached us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time,&rdquo; declared Mistress Harpham,
reassuringly. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go for another hour yet,
my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Colin and Margery were already absorbed
in the second pageant, which, drawn as before by men
(this time by the Plasterers&rsquo; apprentices), had stopped
in the same place just beneath the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Making of Sun, Moon, and Stars: of Birds, Beasts, and Fishes: of Man and Woman. The Garden of Eden</span></h2>
<p>When the curtains were drawn aside, another figure,
representing <span class="sc">God</span> Almighty, was seen seated on a
golden throne. When He spoke, it was to bid the
earth take shape; and as He uttered commands,
various painted cloths were unrolled, falling one over
the other to form a background to His throne.</p>
<p>First, He commanded the light to be divided from
the darkness.</p>
<p>At the word, a curtain, half of which was black, the
other half white, fell from the canopy overhead down
to the rush-strewn floor.</p>
<p>When He bade two great lights appear, &ldquo;the greater
light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the
night,&rdquo; when &ldquo;He made the stars also,&rdquo; a painted
sky was unrolled with the sun, the moon, and the stars
upon it, and a picture of the sea, with fish swimming
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
in it, followed the words, &ldquo;Let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving creature that hath life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the birds are coming!&rdquo; whispered Giles,
just before the command that fowl should &ldquo;fly above
the earth in the open firmament of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as he spoke, a flight of pigeons rose into the
air, first fluttering a moment above the pageant, then
wheeling off in many directions, while the crowd
watched them open-mouthed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Wiseman had them ready in a basket!&rdquo;
Giles eagerly explained. &ldquo;He is standing on the
platform at the back of the stage, behind the sky, you
know; and he let them out just at the right moment,
didn&rsquo;t he? There ought to have been a lot of other
birds, but they are difficult to get. You see what the
direction says?&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to a page in a parchment-covered
book which he held, but Colin and Margery
shook their heads and looked with respect at their
cousin, who could actually read! They remembered
that Giles was said to be a great scholar, and was
probably going to be a priest when he grew up. That,
of course, accounted for his learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it to you,&rdquo; said the boy, remembering that
his cousins knew nothing of books. &ldquo;The words of
the pageant are here, and all the stage directions,
just as Robert Crowe, who wrote out the play for
the Plasterers, has copied them. This is what it
says about the birds&mdash;<i>Then one ought in secret to
put little birds flying in the air and alighting upon the</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
<i>earth with the most foreign birds that one is able to
procure.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; remarked Giles, closing the
book; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s difficult. So they had to make
pigeons do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were so pretty!&rdquo; Margery said. She
did not mind talking for a little while now, for there
were no more painted scenes to look at, and she
scarcely understood the speech which followed the
command for &ldquo;cattle and creeping things, and beasts
of the earth&rdquo; to come into existence.</p>
<p>In a moment however, her attention was again
arrested, for the curtains were drawn, the pageant was
pulled away, and, before it had disappeared, a new one,
the third, had come into sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the <i>Cardmakers&rsquo;</i> play,&rdquo; said Giles, consulting
his pageant book. &ldquo;It is about <span class="sc">God</span> the <span class="sc">Father</span>
creating Adam and Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cardmakers?&rdquo; Margery asked, rather puzzled at
the name. As a country child she did not know all
the trades of the town guilds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the people who make the cards for the
wool to be combed on, before it is made up into stuffs,
you know,&rdquo; Giles told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then comes the <i>Fullers&rsquo;</i> play,&rdquo; he went on, reading
from the book, &ldquo;<span class="sc">God</span> forbidding Adam and Eve to eat
of the Tree of Life. Afterwards the <i>Coopers</i> do Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden; and the serpent
deceiving them with apples; and <span class="sc">God</span> speaking to
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
them and cursing the serpent, and with a sword
driving them out of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, children! you must be hungry!&rdquo; called
Mistress Harpham at this moment. &ldquo;Come and
have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery turned reluctantly from the window,
where, on the scaffolding, the third play was just
beginning; and her aunt laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the child! You can&rsquo;t sit looking at the
pageants all day without food!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;There are plenty more of &rsquo;em in all conscience.
Come along now. Giles will have to go when he&rsquo;s
eaten something. He must soon be starting for his play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time all of the guests were seated at trestle-tables,
which had been placed at the back of the room
and spread with all sorts of food. There were huge
joints, and fat capons, and plenty of ale, to which the
guests did ample justice.</p>
<p>Colin and Margery, with Giles between them, were
squeezed in at one of the tables, and soon discovered
that they were very hungry. There was a great
clattering of plates and knives, and a babel of conversation.
The pageants already seen, were criticized,
praised, or condemned, and compared with those of
the preceding year; and all the guests politely declared
how they were looking forward to the play of the
Parchment-makers and Bookbinders, the guild to
which their host belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that Giles is allowed to be here, and not
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
with his company?&rdquo; inquired the grave but kind-looking
man whom Giles had pointed out as Matthew
Gyseburn, the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The council gave him special permission to stay
at home till the fifth pageant was on its way,&rdquo; explained
his mother. &ldquo;My husband is an important man on
the Town Council, as you know,&rdquo; she added proudly.
&ldquo;And you see, Giles isn&rsquo;t a <i>paid</i> player! He acts for
the love of it&mdash;bless him. And he&rsquo;s none too strong,&rdquo;
she added, lowering her voice. &ldquo;Those hours of
waiting would make him ill. But as soon as ever this
Coopers&rsquo; pageant moves off, his father will take him
to join his company and help him to dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; asked Margery sadly, as Giles
got up from the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. There won&rsquo;t
be any one to tell us all about it now, and I shan&rsquo;t
understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall sit by me, little mistress and master,&rdquo;
said the good-natured lawyer, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my
best to make up for Giles. Here, boy! leave me the
&lsquo;pageant-book,&rsquo; in case I&rsquo;m asked more questions
than I know how to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles gave him the book, and, then anxiously pulling
his father by the arm, forced him to get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So afraid he&rsquo;ll be late!&rdquo; cried Master Harpham,
laughing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s heaps of time; but perhaps we&rsquo;d
better be starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ever get through the crowd?&rdquo; asked
a woman anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know all the backways; don&rsquo;t we, Giles?
We shall slip along the side-alleys in no time, up to
where his pageant is waiting. See you again, neighbours!&rdquo;
He nodded to the company, and, pushing
Giles before him, went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go to the window now?&rdquo; begged
Margery, who could hear the players talking, and
was longing not to miss too many of the plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, my dears, if you have had enough to
eat,&rdquo; said Mistress Harpham.</p>
<p>The children ran to their places, and found the
Coopers&rsquo; play going on.</p>
<p>This pageant, they noticed, had <i>three</i> rooms or stages
one beneath the other. On the highest, or Heaven
stage, sat <span class="sc">God</span> Almighty; beneath it, in the Garden
of Eden, were Adam and Eve; and the third, still lower
stage, represented Earth.</p>
<p>But the children&rsquo;s attention was riveted on the
second stage, round which branches of trees and
flowers were placed to represent a garden. In the
midst was the Tree of Life, with golden fruit upon
it, and in the shadow of the tree there was a strange
group. Adam and Eve, both of whom were played
by tall boys dressed in close-fitting skins dyed flesh-colour,
were talking to a huge serpent who, coiled
round the trunk of the tree, was tempting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some one speaking inside him,&rdquo;
exclaimed Margery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s big enough to hide a boy
at least&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Colin; &ldquo;listen to what he&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serpent&rsquo;s great head was turned towards Eve,
and his voice was full of persuasion. &ldquo;Ye shall not
surely die!&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;for <span class="sc">God</span> doth know that in
the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened,
and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Eve looked longingly at the golden fruit, and
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to pick it!&rdquo; whispered Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! look! She has broken off a branch, and
she&rsquo;s giving the fruit to Adam. Now she&rsquo;s talking
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now they&rsquo;re eating the apples!&rdquo; cried Colin;
&ldquo;and <span class="sc">God</span> will be angry! They know He will be
angry. See, they&rsquo;re hiding themselves. They can
hear His voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And presently, while they watched, <span class="sc">God</span> Almighty
came down the steps which led from Heaven to
Paradise, and entered the garden. Here he questioned
Adam and Eve, and afterwards turned to the serpent
and cursed him. Then, holding a flashing sword
above the heads of the guilty man and woman, He
told them of their punishment; and finally drove them
weeping from the garden, down to the earth, upon
which they were henceforth to live.</p>
<p>The Armourers&rsquo; pageant was by this time waiting
its turn at the corner of the market-place, and when
the Coopers&rsquo; scaffold was dragged away it speedily
took its place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we shall see Adam and Eve&rsquo;s life on the
earth,&rdquo; said the lawyer, who had come to the window,
and was standing just behind the children.</p>
<p>The curtains before the stage were drawn back, and
Adam and Eve, no longer happy and light-hearted,
were seen on the earth, where henceforth they had to
work in sorrow and suffering. As they sadly talked
together, an angel with golden wings appeared to
them. To Adam he gave a spade, bidding him till
the ground, and to Eve a distaff, commanding her
to work for her household.</p>
<p>The Glovers&rsquo; play came next. The characters in it
were Cain and Abel, and the story told of the murder
of Abel by Cain, and of Cain&rsquo;s punishment.</p>
<p>It was all very interesting to the children, but they
were looking forward so eagerly to the following
pageant that they could not refrain from glancing
every now and again towards the corner of the market-place
at which it would appear.</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s ark was the subject, and the lawyer, Master
Gyseburn, had told them it would be an amusing
play.</p>
<p>It did not seem strange to any of the people
assembled that a few of the plays should be written
on purpose to make the audience laugh. It had long
been the custom to make into comic scenes one or two
of the Bible stories in which no sacred characters
appeared. The monks who wrote the plays remembered
how long and how patiently the crowd had to
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
stand, and they thought that if the people sometimes
laughed, their attention would be kept fresh for the
more serious part of the Bible teaching.</p>
<p>So Colin and Margery heard without surprise and
with joyful anticipation that Noah&rsquo;s wife would be
very funny. They were exceedingly anxious also to
see the ark, which Master Gyseburn described as
a wonderful piece of work.</p>
<p>There was altogether a good deal of excitement
about the two following plays, and much conversation
concerning them went on amongst the guests assembled
at Master Harpham&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not our plays&mdash;the York plays&mdash;at all,
are they?&rdquo; asked a pretty young girl who sat near
Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned a neighbour; &ldquo;I hear they are both
borrowed from Chester, because they are better than
our own pageants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very fitting that Noah&rsquo;s ark should be performed
by the Shipwrights and Mariners!&rdquo; said
Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t understand seafaring
business, who should?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it comes!&rdquo; shouted Colin, and every one
gazed eagerly at the approaching pageant, which was
drawn by the Shipwrights&rsquo; apprentices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Noah&rsquo;s Ark</span></h2>
<p>It paused, as usual, just beneath Master Harpham&rsquo;s
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no ark!&rdquo; exclaimed Margery, in
a disappointed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; Colin warned her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s behind
those curtains at the back, I expect. Noah has first
to be told to build it, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin was right, for the play began with <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> announcement
to Noah that the Deluge was approaching,
and His command that a ship should be built.</p>
<p>Then Noah, a venerable old man with a long white
beard, praised <span class="sc">God</span> for the warning, and spoke as
follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O <span class="sc">Lorde</span>, I thank Thee lowde and still,</p>
<p class="t0">That to me arte in suche will,</p>
<p class="t0">And spares me and my howse to spill,</p>
<p class="t0">As I now southly [truly] fynde.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy byddinge, <span class="sc">Lorde</span>, I shall fulfill,</p>
<p class="t0">And never more Thee greve nor grill [provoke]</p>
<p class="t0">That such grace hath sent me till,</p>
<p class="t0">Amongst all mankinde.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s sons and their wives now entered, and the
old man turned to them and told them of the flood
that was coming:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Have done, you men and women all,</p>
<p class="t0">Hye you, lest this watter fall</p>
<p class="t0">To worche [work] this shippe chamber and hall</p>
<p class="t0">As <span class="sc">God</span> hath bidden us doe,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>For the first time now, Noah&rsquo;s wife came in, and
her appearance was greeted by a roar of laughter from
the crowd in the market-place and at the windows.
The people understood that she was meant to be
a very bad-tempered lady, and both her dress and her
face were meant to make them laugh. The part was
of course acted by a man (no woman ever acted in
those days), and the player was a good actor whom
every one knew.</p>
<p>At first the wife did not speak, though all the time
her behaviour was amusing. Meanwhile the sons
declared themselves ready to help with the ark.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Father&rdquo; (said Shem), &ldquo;I am already bowne [prepared],</p>
<p class="t0">An axe I have, by my croune!</p>
<p class="t0">As sharp as any in all this toun</p>
<p class="t0">For to go thereto.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then Ham spoke:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have a hatchet, wonder keen</p>
<p class="t0">To bite well, as may be seen,</p>
<p class="t0">A better ground one, as I ween,</p>
<p class="t0">Is not in all this toun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Japhet also intended to do his best:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And I can well make a pin,</p>
<p class="t0">And with this hammer knock it in,</p>
<p class="t0">Go and work without more din,</p>
<p class="t0">And I am ready bowne [prepared].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But Noah&rsquo;s wife at once showed by her grumbling
speech that she was obstinate, and did not intend to do
much work:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And we shall bring timber too,</p>
<p class="t0">For women nothing else to do;</p>
<p class="t0">Women be weak to undergo</p>
<p class="t0">Any great travail,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she declared.</p>
<p>At last, to the children&rsquo;s delight, the curtains at the
back of the stage parted, and they saw the ark. It
was already very substantially built, for of course in
the few minutes at the actors&rsquo; disposal they could do
no more than <i>pretend</i> to hammer and plane and saw.
Indeed all the time that it was not in use, this
ark hung in one of the churches in York, slung
to the beams across the nave, from which place of
safety it was every year taken down to do duty in
the pageant.</p>
<p>Margery and Colin gazed with admiration upon the
big ship, which was very much like the Noah&rsquo;s arks
we see nowadays in the toy-shops, only of course
enormously larger. It was roofed in at the top, and
gaily painted. There were little windows along the
sides that opened and showed glimpses of rooms
within. A mast with sails and rigging appeared above
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the roof, and altogether a more satisfactory and
interesting ark can scarcely be imagined.</p>
<p>Noah and his sons began at once to work very
busily, as though they were really building, Noah
in these words explaining all there was to do:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now in the Name of <span class="sc">God</span> I will begin</p>
<p class="t0">To make the ship that we shall in,</p>
<p class="t0">That we be ready for to swim</p>
<p class="t0">At the coming of the flood.</p>
<p class="t0">These boards I join together,</p>
<p class="t0">To keep us safe from the weather,</p>
<p class="t0">That we may roam both hither and thither,</p>
<p class="t0">And safe be from this flood.</p>
<p class="t0">Of this tree will I have the mast,</p>
<p class="t0">Tied with cables that will last.</p>
<p class="t0">With a sail-yard for each blast,</p>
<p class="t0">And each thing in its kind.</p>
<p class="t0">With topmast high and bowsprit,</p>
<p class="t0">With cords and ropes I hold all fit</p>
<p class="t0">To sail forth at the next weete [tide]</p>
<p class="t0">This ship is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The ark, now finished by the pretended labours of
the men, Noah turned to his wife and family.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Wife&rdquo; (he said), &ldquo;in this castle we shall be kept;</p>
<p class="t0">My children and thou I would in leaped.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But Noah&rsquo;s wife immediately began to show her
temper. She had been looking all the time with
scorn upon the building of the ship, and laughing
with her neighbours, or &ldquo;gossips,&rdquo; as she called them,
to see her husband and her sons working, as she
considered, so foolishly; and when Noah begged her
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
to come into safety, this was her contemptuous
answer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In faith, Noe, I had as lief thou had slept,</p>
<p class="t0">For all thy frankishfare [nonsense],</p>
<p class="t0">For I will not do after thy rede [advice].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Good wife, do as I thee bid,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>said Noah, coaxingly.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;By <span class="sc">Christ</span> not, or I see more need,</p>
<p class="t0">Though thou stand all the day and rave,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she replied, while the crowd broke into roars of
laughter to see the husband and wife quarrelling.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Lord</span>, that women be crabbed ay!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>exclaimed Noah, amid fresh laughter,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And never are meek, that I dare say.</p>
<p class="t0">This is well seen of me to-day,</p>
<p class="t0">In witness of you each one.</p>
<p class="t0">Good wife, let all this beere [noise]</p>
<p class="t0">That thou makest in this place here;</p>
<p class="t0">For they all ween thou art master,</p>
<p class="t0">And so thou art, by St. John!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But here, in order to attend to the various animals
which had to be taken into the ark, Noah was obliged
to cease arguing for a time; and the way in which this
difficult business of the animals was represented, greatly
amused and interested the children.</p>
<p>Each of Noah&rsquo;s sons and daughters-in-law mentioned
the names of many birds and beasts, and as they
named them, they held up great figures painted on
parchment, and cut out to represent the various
creatures of which they spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p><i>Shem</i> began the list:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sir, here are lions, leopards in,</p>
<p class="t0">Horses, mares, oxen, and swine,</p>
<p class="t0">Goats, calves, sheep, and kine</p>
<p class="t0">Here sitten [settled] may you see.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look at the lion!&rdquo; exclaimed Margery.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he beautiful? And the pig, Colin! Did you
ever see such a fat pig in your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ham</i> had now begun to show the animals in his
charge:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Camels, asses, men may find;</p>
<p class="t0">Buck, doe, hart, and hind,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he chanted, holding up the figure of each beast before
putting it in the ark.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take here cats and dogs too (said <i>Japhet</i>),</p>
<p class="t0">Otter, fox, fulmart also;</p>
<p class="t0">Hares hopping gaily, can ye</p>
<p class="t0">Have kail here for to eat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Presently also Noah&rsquo;s wife, very scornfully laughing,
showed <i>her</i> animals:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And here are bears, wolves set,</p>
<p class="t0">Apes, owls, marmoset;</p>
<p class="t0">Weasels, squirrels, and ferret,</p>
<p class="t0">Here they eat their meat,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>Shem&rsquo;s wife then went on with the list of creatures,
first exclaiming at their number:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yet more beasts are in this house!</p>
<p class="t0">Here cats come in full crowse [comfort],</p>
<p class="t0">Here a rat and here a mouse,</p>
<p class="t0">They stand nigh together.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Margery wondered how the cats would get on
with the rats and mice, but Shem&rsquo;s wife offered no
explanation, and immediately after her followed the
wife of Ham:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And here are fowls, less and more (she declared),</p>
<p class="t0">Herons, cranes, and bittern;</p>
<p class="t0">Swans, peacocks, have them before! [in front]</p>
<p class="t0">Meat for this weather.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here are cocks, kites, crows (said Japhet&rsquo;s wife),</p>
<p class="t0">Rooks, ravens, many rows;</p>
<p class="t0">Cuckoos, curlews, whoso knows,</p>
<p class="t0">Each one in his kind.</p>
<p class="t0">And here are doves, ducks, drakes,</p>
<p class="t0">Redshanks, running through the lakes&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And each fowl that language makes</p>
<p class="t0">In this ship men may find.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At length, after the animals had all gone safely into
the ark, Noah, to the huge delight of the crowd,
turned again to his wife, and once more began to urge
her to enter.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Wife, come in, why standest thou there? (he entreated).</p>
<p class="t0">Thou art ever forward, that I dare swear;</p>
<p class="t0">Come on <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> half [behalf], time it were,</p>
<p class="t0">For fear lest that we drown.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the foolish woman could not be persuaded.
Nothing would induce her to enter the ark, she
declared, unless her &ldquo;gossips&rdquo; were allowed to come
too; and that, as we know from the story of the
Flood, was forbidden, since only Noah and his family
were allowed to embark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yes, sir; set up your sail (said she),</p>
<p class="t0">And row forth with evil heale,</p>
<p class="t0">For without any fail</p>
<p class="t0">I will not out of this town;</p>
<p class="t0">But I have my gossips every one,</p>
<p class="t0">One foot further I will not go.</p>
<p class="t0">They shall not drown, by S. John!</p>
<p class="t0">If I may save their life.</p>
<p class="t0">They loved me full well, by <span class="sc">Christ</span>!</p>
<p class="t0">But thou wilt let them in thy chest,</p>
<p class="t0">Else row forth, Noah, whither thou list,</p>
<p class="t0">And get thee a new wife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather nice of her to want to save her friends,
though&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; exclaimed Margery, who was
breathlessly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she cares a bit about them, really,&rdquo;
said Colin. &ldquo;She only wants to be obstinate, and to
make a fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are they doing? Will she be left
behind?&rdquo; asked Margery, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;You see, Noah is
sending his sons to make her go in. Listen to what
Japhet says. He is just going to speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mother (begged Japhet), we pray you altogether,</p>
<p class="t0">For we are here, your children;</p>
<p class="t0">Come into the ship for fear of the weather.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t go! she won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; cried Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s sending Shem to her again! There!
he&rsquo;s lifted her right in!&rdquo; Colin exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh,
isn&rsquo;t she angry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people all round were laughing so much by
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
this time, that the children could only just hear
Shem&rsquo;s words as he carried his mother up the plank
into the ark:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In faith, mother, yet you shall,</p>
<p class="t0">Whether you will or not!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Welcome, wife, into this boat!&rdquo; (cried Noah.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And have, then, that for thy note!&rdquo; [trouble]</p>
</div>
<p>she returned, boxing her husband&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>At this outbreak the crowd again shouted with
laughter, and went on laughing still more when Noah
put his hands to his ears, moaning and complaining.
By degrees, however, as the flood was supposed to rise
higher and higher, he and his wife were quieted.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Over the land the water spreads! (Noah explained.)</p>
<p class="t0">Now all this world is in a flood,</p>
<p class="t0">As I see well in sight,</p>
<p class="t0">This window will I close anon,</p>
<p class="t0">And into my chamber will I gone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The children eagerly watched him as, one after one,
he closed the windows of the ark, shutting in all the
little company of people and all the beasts and birds
that were to be saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you must imagine that the ark is floating on
the water!&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn, smiling at Colin
and Margery, who found no difficulty at all in doing so.
&ldquo;The windows will be shut for a little while, and
we have to pretend that forty days have passed before
Noah opens them again. Soon we shall hear him
singing, and then we shall see him once more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>In a few moments, indeed, voices were heard within
the ark, upraised in a psalm of praise; and when it
was ended the windows were slowly slipped back, and
at one of them stood Noah, a leaden weight fastened
to a long cord in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked Colin. &ldquo;What is he
going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s going to &lsquo;cast the lead&rsquo; in proper
fashion, just as sailors do when they want to find out
how deep the sea is,&rdquo; explained Master Gyseburn.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that this is the Shipwrights&rsquo; pageant,
and they are learned in all seafaring business, as you
may imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! he&rsquo;s unwinding the line!&rdquo; cried Colin;
&ldquo;and I suppose he finds that the water has gone down?
He can see the tops of the mountains now&mdash;can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>whole</i> of the mountains, I should think!&rdquo;
returned Master Gyseburn, laughing. &ldquo;Listen! he&rsquo;s
going to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now forty days are fully gone (Noah began),</p>
<p class="t0">Send a raven I will anon;</p>
<p class="t0">If aught were earth, tree, or stone,</p>
<p class="t0">Be dry in any place.</p>
<p class="t0">And, if this fowl come not again,</p>
<p class="t0">It is a sign, sooth to say,</p>
<p class="t0">That dry it is, on hill and plain,</p>
<p class="t0">And <span class="sc">God</span> hath done some grace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s going to let out a <i>real</i> raven!&rdquo; said
Margery joyfully. &ldquo;What a big black thing! Look,
how he&rsquo;s clapping his wings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&mdash;now he&rsquo;s flown!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone right over the roofs of those houses
opposite. See how the people are staring after him.
<i>He&rsquo;ll</i> never come back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the dove will!&rdquo; declared Margery excitedly.
&ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s going to let a dove fly now. He&rsquo;s talking
to him&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou wilt turn again to me,</p>
<p class="t0">For of all fowls that may fly</p>
<p class="t0">Thou art most meek and hend [kind],&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>said Noah, as he threw the bird up into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the <i>same</i> bird that comes back&mdash;will
it?&rdquo; asked Colin, looking up at Master Gyseburn,
who smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;there&rsquo;s another dove already fastened with
a cord from the top of the stage. We shall see it in
a minute!&rdquo; And, sure enough, while he was speaking,
the bird came fluttering down, almost into Noah&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s got the olive-branch in its beak!&rdquo;
exclaimed Margery. &ldquo;That shows that the trees are
out of the water&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; listen&mdash;then you will hear Noah saying that
the flood has gone down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;By this sight I well may say,</p>
<p class="t0">This flood begins to cease (Noah was declaring).</p>
<p class="t0">My sweet dove to me brought has</p>
<p class="t0">A branch of olive from some place;</p>
<p class="t0">This betokeneth <span class="sc">God</span> has done us some grace,</p>
<p class="t0">And is a sign of peace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>By this time all the windows in the ark were open,
disclosing the whole family, including Noah&rsquo;s wife,
who looked much subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s glad she&rsquo;s saved now!&rdquo; Margery remarked.
&ldquo;Look!&mdash;they&rsquo;re all coming out, and <span class="sc">God</span> is talking
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is promising that the rainbow shall be a sign
from heaven that the earth shall never more be
drowned,&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over
now. Look!&mdash;the men are dragging the pageant
away to the next halting-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>now</i> it&rsquo;s Abraham and Isaac!&rdquo; said Margery
joyfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Story of Abraham and of Isaac</span></h2>
<p>Both the children looked anxiously in the direction
from which all the pageants coming from the gates
of the Priory, approached the market-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in sight yet!&rdquo; said Colin in surprise, for
hitherto one pageant had followed swiftly upon
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but here&rsquo;s a man on horseback, dressed
<i>splendidly</i>!&rdquo; Margery cried. &ldquo;What is he going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s part of the play,&rdquo; Master Gyseburn explained.
&ldquo;He is a messenger who is going to tell
us what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the rider, who came from a side-street,
was clattering over the stones of the market-place.
Just beneath the window he drew up his horse, and,
raising his plumed cap, began in these words to
address the multitude:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All peace, Lordings, that be present,</p>
<p class="t0">And hearken now with good intent</p>
<p class="t0">How Noah away from us he went</p>
<p class="t0">With all his company;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p class="t0">And Abraham, through <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> grace</p>
<p class="t0">He is come forth into this place,</p>
<p class="t0">And you will give him room and space</p>
<p class="t0">To tell you his storye.</p>
<p class="t0">This play, forsooth, begin shall he,</p>
<p class="t0">In worship of the Trinity,</p>
<p class="t0">That you may all hear and see</p>
<p class="t0">What shall be done to-day.</p>
<p class="t0">My name is Gobbet-on-the-Green,</p>
<p class="t0">No longer here I may be seen;</p>
<p class="t0">Farewell, my Lordings, all by dene [in haste]</p>
<p class="t0">For letting [hindering] of your play.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Setting spurs to his horse, the messenger, a brilliant
figure in a doublet of sapphire blue laced with gold,
and long crimson hose, rode away, disappearing at the
opposite corner of the market-place from that at which
he had entered.</p>
<p>And now another figure came into view, also
riding.</p>
<p>This was a stately man in long robes, wearing a
curious turban of linen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Abraham?&rdquo; asked Colin. &ldquo;But where
is Isaac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; answered Master Gyseburn.
&ldquo;The story, you see, begins long before Isaac
is born. Abraham has just returned from his victory
over the four kings. Listen! He is explaining how
the kings took his nephew Lot prisoner, and how he
released him, and conquered the kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s another man coming on horseback!&rdquo;
said Margery. &ldquo;Oh! look how beautifully he is
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
dressed, with rubies on his gown, and on the thing
that comes over his forehead. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Melchizedek, King of Salem, and priest of
the Most High <span class="sc">God</span>. He is coming to bless Abraham
for conquering the kings, and to give him bread and
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! A servant is holding up a golden cup to
him and a golden plate!&rdquo; said Colin. &ldquo;And now
he&rsquo;s going to give the bread and wine to Abraham,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This duly happened as Colin had guessed, for
Melchizedek, reining up his horse close to Abraham,
began to speak, offering him presently the golden
cup and platter:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abraham, welcome must thou be,</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> grace is fully in thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Blessed ever must thou be</p>
<p class="t0">That enemies so can make.</p>
<p class="t0">I have brought, as thou may&rsquo;st see,</p>
<p class="t0">Bread and wine for thy degree;</p>
<p class="t0">Receive this present now from me,</p>
<p class="t0">And that I thee beseke [beseech].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then Abraham, taking the bread and wine, answered
in this fashion:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sir King, welcome in good say,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy present is welcome to my pay.</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God</span> has helped me to-day,</p>
<p class="t0">Unworthy though I were.</p>
<p class="t0">He shall have part of my prey</p>
<p class="t0">That I won since I went away.</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore to thee thou take it may,</p>
<p class="t0">The tenth I offer thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>At this moment a horse richly laden with all sorts
of precious gifts of gold and silver and jewels was led
forward by a page. The beautiful animal had splendid
harness and trappings upon him, and he walked
proudly as though conscious of the royal presents he
brought.</p>
<p>Melchizedek accepted the gift and, after further talk
with Abraham, rode away, followed by his servants,
who led the laden steed.</p>
<p>Abraham now wheeled his horse aside to make
room for the messenger, who rode into the cleared
space, and once more addressed the audience. In a
long speech he explained to the people that the
scene they had just witnessed was a sort of parable,
and meant the Holy Communion, the Bread and
Wine commemorating <span class="sc">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sacrifice for the world.</p>
<p>So far the pageant or wooden stage had not been
used at all. All the characters had come riding in
to act their parts. But now the platform which
stood waiting in the background, was drawn into
the midst of the open space, and the rest of the
play took place as usual, upon it.</p>
<p>First <span class="sc">God</span> the <span class="sc">Father</span> appeared, and Abraham
entreated Him to send him a child to be his heir.
The Almighty promised to grant his request, laid
various commands upon him, and told him that his
descendants should be as the stars of heaven for
number; and the scene ended with Abraham kneeling
to bless and thank the <span class="sc">Lord</span> for His mercy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The curtains were now drawn, and before they
were once more unclosed, the messenger again rode
up, and explained to the people how some of the
commands which <span class="sc">God</span> had just given to Abraham
pointed to and foreshadowed the Sacrament of
Baptism, which followed the birth of <span class="sc">Christ</span>.</p>
<p>When he had ridden away, and the curtains of
the pageant again swung back, the children grew
very excited, for almost the first words of the scene
told them that Isaac might soon be expected to
appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn, &ldquo;that some
years are supposed to have passed between the last
scene and this. <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> promise has been fulfilled,
and Abraham now has a son. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham was alone on the stage, but just as
Master Gyseburn finished speaking, <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> voice was
heard:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abraham, My servant Abraham!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lo, <span class="sc">Lord</span>, already here I am,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>replied Abraham.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take Isaac thy son by name,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the voice continued,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And in sacrifice offer him to Me</p>
<p class="t0">Upon that hill, beside thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Abraham, I will that it so be</p>
<p class="t0">For aught that may befall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Though almost stunned with grief at the command,
Abraham at once declared himself ready to obey the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
<span class="sc">Lord</span>. He said that all his household should remain
at home except Isaac, with whom he would go to the
appointed hill.</p>
<p>By this time Mistress Harpham was leaning
anxiously over the children&rsquo;s shoulders, for she knew
that Giles in the character of Isaac was waiting to
come on to the stage. All the guests were also
very excited and full of expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well that the boy acts with so good a man
as Master Eliott!&rdquo; exclaimed a woman who stood
close to her hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye! John Eliott is a rare good player!&rdquo;
answered Mistress Harpham nervously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
never had a better &lsquo;Abraham&rsquo; than he makes, and
he&rsquo;s taken such pains with Giles too, teaching him
and training him for the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is! There he is!&rdquo; cried Margery, as
a pretty, delicate little figure in a linen tunic entered.
&ldquo;Oh! <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> he look nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, with his fair curly hair and sweet face,
Giles made quite a touching little Isaac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush! Abraham is speaking,&rdquo; Master
Gyseburn reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make thee ready, my darling,&rdquo; he was saying in a
voice which made Margery feel as though she wanted
to cry:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Make thee ready, my darling,</p>
<p class="t0">For we must do a little thing;</p>
<p class="t0">This wood upon thy back you bring,</p>
<p class="t0">We must not long abide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p class="t0">A sword and fire I will take,</p>
<p class="t0">For sacrifice I must make;</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> bidding will I not forsake,</p>
<p class="t0">But ay obedient be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There was a deep silence in the crowd, as speaking
in a very clear, gentle voice, Isaac made reply:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Father, I am all ready</p>
<p class="t0">To do your bidding meekly;</p>
<p class="t0">To bear this wood full bound am I</p>
<p class="t0">As you command me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Abraham then in trembling tone gave a blessing
to his son, whose look of bewilderment and growing
fear brought tears to the eyes of some of the women at
the window.</p>
<p>Then, after the old man had bound the wood on
the boy&rsquo;s back, he was suddenly overcome with misery.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh! my heart will break in three,</p>
<p class="t0">To hear thy words I have pity,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he exclaimed. But the cry of despair was immediately
followed by</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As thou wilt, <span class="sc">Lord</span>, so must it be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Still wondering and afraid, Isaac spoke:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Are you anything adread? (he asked)</p>
<p class="t0">Father, if it be your will,</p>
<p class="t0">Where is the beast that we shall kill?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And when Abraham told him that he saw no animal
at all, the boy went on in a shaking voice:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Father, I am full sore afraid</p>
<p class="t0">To see you bare this naked sword.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p class="t0">I hope for all middle-yard [instead of any creature from the farmyard],</p>
<p class="t0">You will not slay your child?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then the father, who could not bear to detect the
fear in his boy&rsquo;s voice, tried to comfort him by saying
that the <span class="sc">Lord</span> would surely provide some beast that
might be slain for the sacrifice. But Isaac was not
satisfied. He begged the old man to tell him whether
any evil would happen to him, and at the entreaty
Abraham could no longer hide his terrible grief,
but broke into wild words.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ah, dear <span class="sc">God</span>, that me is woe!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou bursts my heart in sunder,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he exclaimed, wringing his hands; and finally, when
Isaac again implored him to hide nothing from him,
he told the dreadful truth.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Isaac, Isaac, I must thee kill!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he cried.</p>
<p>Then poor little Isaac went down on his knees
and entreated his father to spare him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Alas! father,&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;is that your will,</p>
<p class="t0">Your own child here for to spill</p>
<p class="t0">Upon this hill&rsquo;s brink?</p>
<p class="t0">If I have trespassed in any degree</p>
<p class="t0">With a rod you may beat me;</p>
<p class="t0">Put up your sword, if your will be,</p>
<p class="t0">For I am but a child....</p>
<p class="t0">Would <span class="sc">God</span> my mother were here with me!</p>
<p class="t0">She would kneel upon her knee,</p>
<p class="t0">Praying you, father, if it might be,</p>
<p class="t0">For to save my life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>By this time Mistress Harpham was crying, and
so were many other mothers in the crowd, while
they listened to the boy&rsquo;s voice, and the words of
Abraham as he explained to his son that this terrible
thing must come to pass because it was <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span>
command.</p>
<p>Isaac listened, and, forgetting himself, tried very
sweetly to comfort his poor father, begging him not to
linger, but to do the deed quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, tell my mother of nothing,&rdquo; he implored,
anxious to spare her the knowledge of his fate;
and then he asked that a handkerchief might be tied
over his eyes to prevent him from seeing the flash
of the sword.</p>
<p>Most of the women hid their own eyes while poor
little Isaac was bound and laid upon the altar; when
the boy spoke again, for the last time, they sobbed
aloud.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now, father, I see that I shall die!</p>
<p class="t0">Almighty <span class="sc">God</span> in Majesty,</p>
<p class="t0">My soul I offer unto Thee;</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">Lord</span>, to it be kind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Margery could not look when Abraham, snatching
up the sword, held it high over the child&rsquo;s head, and it
was only when she heard a gentle voice that she dared
to take her hands from her eyes.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abraham, My servant dear!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look up! He&rsquo;s not going to be hurt,&rdquo; whispered
Colin. &ldquo;The angel has come. <i>Two</i> angels!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>With great relief Margery gazed at them. They
were beautiful, she thought, with their long golden
wings, and their white gowns; and she loved them for
coming to save poor little Isaac.</p>
<p>She saw that Abraham had dropped his sword, and
she heard his trembling voice saying,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Lo, Lord! I am already here.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lay not thy sword in any manner</p>
<p class="t0">On Isaac, thy dear darling!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>replied one of the gracious angels, while the other
pointed to a ram which was struggling in a thicket
of bushes close by, and bade Abraham sacrifice the
animal instead of his only son.</p>
<p>Then Abraham rejoiced, and offered praise to <span class="sc">God</span>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ah, <span class="sc">Lord</span> of heaven, and King of bliss!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bidding I shall do, I wis;</p>
<p class="t0">Sacrifice here to me sent is,</p>
<p class="t0">And all, <span class="sc">Lord</span>, through Thy grace.</p>
<p class="t0">A horn&egrave;d wether here I see,</p>
<p class="t0">Among the briars tied is he.</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee offered it shall be</p>
<p class="t0">Anon, right in this place.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Margery drew a long breath when, just before the
curtains were closed, she saw Abraham unbinding and
embracing his poor little son. But even then the
play was not quite over, for again the messenger rode
forward, and, placing himself in front of the pageant,
explained to the audience that Isaac was a type of
<span class="sc">Christ</span>, and that the sacrifice was meant to foreshadow
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
His death upon the Cross. These were the words of
his message:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lordings, the signification</p>
<p class="t0">Of this deed of devotion,</p>
<p class="t0">An you will, it is shown,</p>
<p class="t0">May turn you to much good.</p>
<p class="t0">This deed you see done in this place,</p>
<p class="t0">In example of <span class="sc">Jesus</span> done it was,</p>
<p class="t0">That for to win mankind grace</p>

<br /><span class="sc">The Shepherds&rsquo; Play</span></h2>
<p>Many were the exclamations of wonder and delight at
the performance, and many the congratulations to the
parents of the little actor, when <i>The Sacrifice of Isaac</i>
passed on its way to the next halting-place. Indeed so
excited and talkative were the guests at the house of
Master Harpham, that the four following pageants
received little attention from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor child will be worn out before evening
comes!&rdquo; declared the women again and again, and
Giles&rsquo; mother agreed. &ldquo;Though he so loves playing,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t think he feels the fatigue as
much as one might imagine. I know who <i>will</i> be worn
out, though!&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning to Mistress
Short. &ldquo;Your little ones ought to go and rest awhile.
It&rsquo;s altogether too long a day for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin and Margery protested, but their mother was
firm, and they were obliged to follow her to Mistress
Harpham&rsquo;s guest-room, the grandest they had ever
seen, where Margery was placed on the big four-posted
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
bed of oak, and Colin, grumbling a great
deal, was forced to lie down on a little truckle-bed at
its foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all the fresher, and enjoy the plays all
the better for a bit of a sleep,&rdquo; Mistress Harpham
assured them. &ldquo;And you shall be called in time for
the Shepherds&rsquo; play&mdash;that I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery brightened at this, for she had heard that
the Shepherds&rsquo; play was the most popular of all the
pageants, and she had been afraid of missing it.
Though she and Colin had laughed at the idea of
&ldquo;a bit of a sleep,&rdquo; each found a strange feeling of
drowsiness creeping nearer, and considering that they
had been up since daybreak, and it was now past noon,
this was not so surprising as they considered it. At
any rate, when their mother softly entered the room
an hour later, she roused both children from sleep.</p>
<p>The Shepherds&rsquo; play, she told them, was expected
in a few minutes; and they ran eagerly into the front
room to take their old places at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell us what they&rsquo;ve been acting!&rdquo; begged
Margery, as their friend Master Gyseburn welcomed
them with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! we&rsquo;ve had <i>Moses lifting up the Serpent in the
Wilderness</i>. That was the Hosiers&rsquo; pageant. Then
came the Grocers with the <i>Salutation of Mary to Elisabeth</i>.
Next came <i>Mary and Joseph with an angel commanding
them to go to Bethlehem</i>, acted by the Pewterers;
and the last one was the Tylers&rsquo; (Thatchers&rsquo;) pageant
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
of the <i>Stable at Bethlehem, with the Child Jesus in the
Manger</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we wanted to see that!&rdquo; exclaimed both the
children, very disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; Master Gyseburn assured them. &ldquo;After
this pageant, the Shepherds go to the stable to worship
the Child, so the manger scene appears again; in fact
it appears several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the stir and noise in the crowd below, it was
evident that the Shepherds&rsquo; play was awaited with
great eagerness. There was a pushing and scrambling
in the throng, which had greatly increased in numbers.
Many people who had strolled away to get something
to eat and drink had returned, and were trying to
recover their lost places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a funny play?&rdquo; asked Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;The Shepherds&rsquo;
play, or at any rate the first part of it, is always
expected to be amusing. It is an old custom, and
the people would be very disappointed, and perhaps
angry, if it were changed. This particular play is one
that is always acted at Wakefield, but our Chandlers
have borrowed it this year, because it is such a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! this is the Chandlers&rsquo; pageant, then?&rdquo; asked
Margery.</p>
<p>Master Gyseburn nodded. &ldquo;Here it comes,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;You will find that it has very little to do with
the Bible story about the Shepherds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a made-up play, I suppose?&rdquo; said Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Just a funny story to make people
laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the pageant stood in its place before
the Harphams&rsquo; window, and the children noticed that
the big stage was divided into two parts. One part
represented a field, in which three shepherds were
seated with their sheep huddled round them; and
next to this scene, on a line with it, there was a sort
of separate compartment, at present covered by curtains.</p>
<p>The shepherds began at once to grumble about the
weather. They complained of the cold, which one of
them said made his legs cramped, and his hands all
chapped.</p>
<p>Neither Margery nor Colin, nor indeed any of the
simple people who watched the play, found anything
strange in this. Indeed very few of them realized
that all the events they were watching, took place in
an Eastern country, whose scenery and climate were
very different from anything that was represented by
the pageant. They imagined all the scenes as happening
in a country very like England&mdash;if not in
England itself! So the shepherds talked about
the &ldquo;moors,&rdquo; which, as you know, spread through
Yorkshire, and of &ldquo;bannocks,&rdquo; which are special cakes
made in the North of England, and of &ldquo;ale,&rdquo; the
usual English drink; and no one criticized nor found
fault, because scarcely anybody knew, or remembered,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
if they knew, that <span class="sc">Christ&rsquo;s</span> life was spent in a warm
far-away Eastern land, whose manners, customs, and
language were as different as possible from those of
England.</p>
<p>The shepherds talked about many things familiar in
the every-day life of most of the people in the crowd.
They grumbled about the taxes they had to pay, and
they gossiped about their wives, who they said were
always scolding and nagging; and they complained
bitterly about their hard work, and their low wages.
And the listening people laughed and were delighted,
because all they heard came home to them and was
thoroughly well understood.</p>
<p>Presently another shepherd entered, dressed like
the rest in a linen smock, though over it he had
thrown a heavy cloak. His appearance was hailed by
a shout of delight from the audience, for he was a
favourite actor, and the part he was going to play was
well known.</p>
<p>His name was Mac, and with the shepherds he
evidently had the reputation of a thief, for directly he
arrived one of them warned the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he come?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Then each one take
heed to his things!&rdquo; And to make sure of him when
they thought of going to sleep, the men forced him to
lie down in the midst of them, so that if he stirred
they would be warned.</p>
<p>But no sooner did his companions begin to snore
than Mac got up, and walking round the men, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
worked a spell upon them to make them sleep heavily,
chanting these words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be about you a circle as round as the moon</p>
<p class="t0">Till I have done that I will, till that it be noon,</p>
<p class="t0">That ye lie stone-still till that I have done.</p>
<p class="t0">Over your heads my hand I lift, ...</p>
<p class="t0">Out go your eyes, fore to do your sight....&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then seeing that they were all motionless, he crept
to the flock, and taking a fat sheep, put it under his
cloak.</p>
<p>At this moment the curtains in front of the other
division of the stage were pulled aside, showing a poor
cottage room, in which sat Mac&rsquo;s wife spinning. A
little wicket-gate in front of the cottage was locked,
and Mac (who was supposed to have walked some
distance to his home) began to knock upon it, and to
beg his wife to let him in. At first she was angry
with him, saying that one day he would be hanged for
sheep-stealing. But the first question after all was to
decide how they were to hide the sheep during the
search which was sure to be made by its owners. And
here Mac&rsquo;s wife showed her quick wits, for she suggested
a splendid way out of the difficulty. This was
to dress the creature up as a baby, and put it in the
cradle!</p>
<p>Mac agreed, and there were roars of laughter as the
poor struggling sheep was wrapped in flannels and
robes, and at last tucked so securely in the cradle that
it could not move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>When this was at last accomplished, Mac went back
to the field, and lying down quietly in his old place,
pretended to be fast asleep. Then one by one the
shepherds awoke, and began to tell their dreams. All
of them except Mac had dreamt that a sheep had been
carried off; and <i>Mac</i>, so he said, had dreamt that his
wife was very ill. He pretended to be much concerned
and, telling the men he must go and see
whether anything had happened to her, he got up and
once more went home. Meanwhile the shepherds
began to count their flock, and presently found that a
sheep was missing. It was Mac, of course!&mdash;who
else could have stolen it?&mdash;and at once in a body they
rushed to his house, and insisted upon searching it.</p>
<p>No sheep could they find, and Mac and his wife
pretended to be so angry at being disturbed, that at
last the shepherds were leaving the cottage in despair,
when an idea occurred to one of them.</p>
<p>He suddenly exclaimed that he would like to give
something to the little baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mac, by your leave, let me give your bairn but
sixpence</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nay, go &rsquo;way, he sleeps</i>,&rdquo; returned Mac. &ldquo;<i>When he
wakens he weeps</i>,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;<i>I pray you go hence.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Give me leave him to kiss, and lift up the clout</i>,&rdquo;
begged one of the other men. And before Mac&rsquo;s
wife could prevent him he had pulled down the
blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He has a long snout!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the shepherd,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
who had only caught one glimpse of the strange
&ldquo;baby&rdquo; in the cradle.</p>
<p>But Mac&rsquo;s wife was most indignant, and at once
declared that it was a beautiful baby:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A pretty child is he</p>
<p class="t0">As sits upon a woman&rsquo;s knee;</p>
<p class="t0">A dylly-downe, perdie,</p>
<p class="t0">To make a man laugh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But all she could say was useless, for by this time
of course the shepherds were very suspicious, and the
sheep was pulled out from the cradle, while the
market-place rang with laughter. The angry shepherds,
seizing a blanket, now forced Mac into it, and
to the huge delight of the crowd, before returning to
their field they tossed him violently, as a punishment
for his evil-doing.</p>
<p>The laughter caused by this farce had scarcely died
away when the serious part of the performance began.
A second stage had been drawn meanwhile to the
market-place, and was stationed at a little distance
from the first one, where to the shepherds, once more
quietly guarding their flock, there suddenly appeared
an angel. The simple countrymen gazed in awe, while
in a sweet voice he sang <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, and then, as
he came closer, they sank on their knees, while he
addressed them:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rise, gracious hired-men, for now is He born</p>
<p class="t0">That shall take from the fiend that Adam had lorn [lost] ...</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God</span> is made your friend: now at this morn</p>
<p class="t0">He behests [commands]</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p class="t0">To Bedlem go see</p>
<p class="t0">There lies that free [Divine One]</p>
<p class="t0">In a crib full poorly,</p>
<p class="t0">Betwixt two beasts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In amaze the shepherds listened, and in amaze they
talked together when the shining angel had gone.</p>
<p>Pointing to a brilliant star, one of them declared it
was a token to guide them &ldquo;where the young Child
lay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hie we thither quickly;</p>
<p class="t0">If we be wet and weary,</p>
<p class="t0">To that Child and that Lady,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>another urged. And so descending from the stage-field,
they began their journey to Bethlehem, a journey
represented by the space between the two pageants.</p>
<p>On the other platform meanwhile a charming scene
was disclosed. There was the stable at Bethlehem,
with its broken roof, and within the stable Mary in a
long blue robe knelt beside the manger, at which,
with their kind, patient eyes, an ox and an ass were
also gazing.</p>
<p>Now the shepherds had arrived, and finding themselves
in the presence of &ldquo;that Child and that Lady,&rdquo;
they bent low their knees, and began to talk to the
Baby <span class="sc">Jesus</span> as though they loved Him, and as though
He were a child of their own to whom they had
brought tiny presents.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail, comely and clean; hail, young child!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>said the first shepherd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lo, He merry is;</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, He laughs, my sweeting,</p>
<p class="t0">A welcome meeting!</p>
<p class="t0">I have given my greeting,</p>
<p class="t0">Have a bob of cherries?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then in the same homely, delightful way, the
second shepherd greeted the Baby:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail, Sovereign Saviour, for Thou hast us sought!</p>
<p class="t0">Hail! I kneel and I cower.... A bird have I brought</p>
<p class="t0">To my bairn.</p>
<p class="t0">Hail, little tiny mop [little tiny pate] ...</p>
<p class="t0">Little day-starn [star].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And the third shepherd said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail, darling dear, full of Godheed!</p>
<p class="t0">I pray Thee be near when that I have need....</p>
<p class="t0">Hail, put forth Thy dall [hand],</p>
<p class="t0">I bring Thee but a ball:</p>
<p class="t0">Have and play Thee with all,</p>
<p class="t0">And go to the tennis.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mary, bending down to the shepherds, then spoke
to them gently, telling them that she would pray her
Son to keep them from woe, and bidding them spread
the glad tidings of His birth. After a while the shepherds
left her presence, singing glad songs in honour
of the new-born King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that best of all, except Abraham and Isaac!&rdquo;
Margery exclaimed, as the pageants were drawn away.
&ldquo;And <i>now</i> we shall see the wicked King Herod, shan&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">King Herod, the Wise Men, and the Massacre of the Innocents</span></h2>
<p>That the children should long to see the pageant in
which Herod appeared was no wonder, for he was a
very well-known character in the miracle plays. Just
as in some fairy tales the wicked giant is well known,
and is always expected to be as wicked as possible, so
in these plays Herod was always represented as a furious
tyrant and a great boaster, who raged and stormed and
used such exaggerated language that he seemed more
like a madman than a sane human being. Though in
the time of Queen Elizabeth miracle plays were
growing rare, it is just possible that Shakespeare as
a boy may have seen some of them, and when he makes
Hamlet say that one of the actors in the play-scene
&ldquo;out-herods Herod,&rdquo; he may have been thinking of
the particular stamping and shouting Herod whom he
himself had watched. But in any case, during the
lifetime of Shakespeare the memory of the furious
king must have lingered in the minds of old people
at Stratford-on-Avon, many of whom as children must
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
often have seen him blustering and screaming and
ordering people to be killed.</p>
<p>At the windows of Master Robert Harpham&rsquo;s house
at any rate, on this June day when Henry V was king,
there was much talk about the coming &ldquo;Herod,&rdquo; who
was said to be an excellent player and to rage more
furiously than any of the actors who had taken part in
previous years. Excitement therefore ran high, when
the Goldsmiths&rsquo; pageant drew up, for in their play&mdash;<i>The
Three Kings coming from the East</i>&mdash;Herod was for
the first time to appear.</p>
<p>The stage represented Herod&rsquo;s palace. It was
a very small palace, and it looked something like an
enlarged sentry-box, brightly painted and ornamented
at the top with a dome and various pinnacles. From
its doorway, on to the space in front of it, there
presently stepped a herald, who in these pompous
words announced the coming of the King:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Peace, Lord Barons of great renown!</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, Sir Knights of noble presence!</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, gentleman companions of noble order!</p>
<p class="t0">I command that all of you keep silence.</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, while your noble king is in presence!</p>
<p class="t0">Let no person stint to pay him deference;</p>
<p class="t0">Be not bold to strike, but keep your hearts in patience,</p>
<p class="t0">And to your lord keep heart of reverence,</p>
<p class="t0">For he, your king, has all <i>puissance</i>!</p>
<p class="t0">In the name of the law, I command you peace!</p>
<p class="t0">And King Herod&mdash;&lsquo;<i>la grandeaboly vos umport.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The last words, spoken by the herald in a low voice
and with a knowing smile, were greeted with a roar of
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
delight, for Herod was to some extent a comic
character, at whom every one might laugh and &ldquo;<i>la
grandeaboly vos umport</i>&rdquo; is bad French for &ldquo;<i>the devil
run away with you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Herod himself majestically strode forth,
and again laughter, half derisive, half admiring, rang
out, for in spite of all the boasting and stamping which
every one knew was coming, he made a magnificent
figure.</p>
<p>Dressed as a Saracen, he wore wonderful Eastern
robes, and a jewelled turban. His black hair was
dishevelled, his face red and angry, and with his
flashing eyes, and huge flashing sword, he looked
formidable enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qui status in Jude ex Rex Israel</i>,&rdquo; he began in a
loud commanding tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means&mdash;&lsquo;He that reigns King in Judea and
Israel,&rsquo;&rdquo; explained Master Gyseburn to the children.
&ldquo;Now listen to his boasting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Qui status in Jude et Rex Israel,</p>
<p class="t0">And the mightiest conquerer that ever</p>
<p class="t0">Walked on ground&rdquo; (Herod went on),</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For I am even he that made both heaven and hell,</p>
<p class="t0">And of my mighty power holdeth up this world round.</p>
<p class="t0">I am the cause of this great light and thunder.</p>
<p class="t0">It is through my fury that they such noise do make.</p>
<p class="t0">My fearful countenance the clouds doth so encumber,</p>
<p class="t0">That often for dread thereof the very earth doth shake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was only part of the foolish king&rsquo;s boasting,
for he went on to declare that with one word he could
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
destroy the whole world from the north unto the
south; that he was prince of purgatory and chief
captain of hell. No tongue, he declared, could tell of
his possessions, his wealth, and his power. At last,
turning to his servant the herald, he warned him
to allow no strangers to pass through the realm
without paying tribute to him, and bade him be
gone hastily,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For they that will the contrary,</p>
<p class="t0">Upon a gallows hanged shall be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then ordering &ldquo;trumpets, viols, and other harmony&rdquo;
to announce his presence to all the world, Herod re-entered
the palace, and the herald departed to do his
bidding.</p>
<p>Now appeared riding through the market-place in
great state, two of the three kings from the East. They
were mounted on white horses with beautiful trappings,
and each horse had a long cloth of velvet over his
back. The kings were Gaspar (or Jaspar) and
Balthazar. The first was an old man with a long white
beard, the second a man in the prime of life. They
both wore crowns of gold upon which the sunshine
sparkled, and their dresses of wonderful colours were
embroidered with jewels. Both of them had seen the
Star in the East, and from a far country had followed
it into Herod&rsquo;s kingdom. As they rode, they talked
together, reminding one another that the prophets had
foretold the birth of a wonderful Child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Presently, riding from another direction, came the
third king, Melchior, a handsome youth also crowned
and richly clothed. He was looking about him as he
came, evidently seeking some guide, and his words
showed that he too had seen the Star in the East.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I ride wandering in ways wide,</p>
<p class="t0">Over mountains and dales, I wot not where I am.</p>
<p class="t0">Now King of all kings send me such guide,</p>
<p class="t0">That I may have knowledge of this country&rsquo;s name....</p>
<p class="t0">Two kings yonder, I see, and to them will I ride,</p>
<p class="t0">For to have their company I trust they will me abide [await].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Spurring his horse, he rode up to the two monarchs
and addressed them:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail, comely kings augent [gentle],</p>
<p class="t0">Good sirs, I pray you, whither are ye meant?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To seek a Child is our intent,</p>
<p class="t0">Which betokens yonder star as ye may see,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>said the old king, Gaspar.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To whom I purpose this present,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>added Balthazar, showing him a golden vase full of
frankincense.</p>
<p>Then the third king, Melchior, replied,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sirs, I pray you, and that right humbly,</p>
<p class="t0">With you that I may ride in company;</p>
<p class="t0">To Almighty <span class="sc">God</span> now pray we</p>
<p class="t0">That His precious person we may see.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus having greeted one another, the kings rode
aside, while on the pageant, Herod came out of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
palace to meet the herald, who, on seeing him,
exclaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail, Lord, most of might!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy commandment is right.</p>
<p class="t0">Into thy land is come this night</p>
<p class="t0">Three kings, and with them a great company.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What make those kings in this country?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>returned Herod.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To seek a King and a Child, they say,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>answered the herald.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of what age should He be?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Herod inquired angrily.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Scant twelve days old fully,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>said the herald.</p>
<p>Whereupon Herod, restraining his wrath, commanded
the herald on pain of death to follow the
kings, to speak gently to them, in order to deceive
them into imagining that they would be well treated,
and then to speed in hot haste to Jerusalem to make
inquiries about the Child they sought.</p>
<p>So the herald, descending from the stage, followed
Gaspar, Balthazar, and Melchior, and very courteously
told them that Herod, &ldquo;king of these countries wide,&rdquo;
desired to speak with them. The travellers, immediately
agreeing to his wish, were brought before the
palace. There Herod received them courteously,
wished them a safe journey, and begged them to return
the same way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And with great concord banquet with me,</p>
<p class="t0">And that Child myself then will I see</p>
<p class="t0">And honour Him also,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he added, allowing his guests to depart with many
compliments on either side.</p>
<p>But no sooner had they mounted their horses and
ridden away than Herod&rsquo;s rage blazed forth.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When they come again, they shall die that same day,</p>
<p class="t0">And thus these vile wretches to death shall be brought!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he exclaimed, stalking into his palace, while the kings
rode a little distance to another pageant where again
the stable at Bethlehem was represented, with Mary
watching by the manger.</p>
<p>Here, just as the shepherds had done, but in much
more stately language, they offered their costly gifts
to the Child.</p>
<p>Gaspar gave a cup of gold. &ldquo;<i>In tokening Thou art
without peer</i>,&rdquo; he said, as he laid his offering at the
foot of the manger.</p>
<p>A cup full of frankincense was Balthazar&rsquo;s gift,
&ldquo;<i>In tokening of priesthood and dignity of office</i>;&rdquo; while
the young king Melchior had brought a precious
goblet, with &ldquo;<i>myrrh for mortality, in tokening Thou
shalt mankind restore to life by Thy death upon a tree</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mary spoke to the kings as sweetly as she
had addressed the shepherds, and presently they withdrew
a little from her presence and began to discuss
their homeward journey. Gaspar declared that according
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
to their promise they must return through
Herod&rsquo;s land; and though the others agreed, they
were all so fatigued that they decided to lie down
and rest awhile. Accordingly, at a distance from the
manger, they threw themselves on the ground. Before
long they slept, and while they slept, a beautiful vision
appeared to them.</p>
<p>An angel, who seemed to be hovering in the air,
descended from the darkness of the stable-roof, and
bent still hovering above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he <i>really</i> flying?&rdquo; exclaimed Margery, in an
awed voice; and Master Gyseburn smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though he were, certainly,&rdquo; he agreed;
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a clever contrivance arranged by the
carpenters and fastened to the roof up there, by which
the angel is let down and made to look as though he
were fluttering in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is <i>lovely</i>!&rdquo; declared Margery, sighing with
pleasure. &ldquo;Look at his golden curls and his long
wings! What is he going to say to the kings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Colin advised her.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;King of Tarsus, Sir Gaspar!&rdquo; (exclaimed the angel)</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;King of Araby, Sir Balthazar!</p>
<p class="t0">Melchior, King of Aginara!</p>
<p class="t0">To you now I am sent.</p>
<p class="t0">For dread of Herod, go you west home ...</p>
<p class="t0">The <span class="sc">Holy Ghost</span> this knowledge hath sent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, bending a moment longer over the still
sleeping kings, he flew upwards and was lost to
sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>When the kings awoke, it was to discover that each
one of them had heard the angel&rsquo;s warning; so taking
a last leave of the Babe and His Mother, they set
out on their journey, carefully arranging not to pass
through the dominions of the wicked and treacherous
Herod.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the herald, in fear and trembling, once
more ascended the steps leading to the palace-portal,
and broke the news to his master:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;These three kings that forth were sent,</p>
<p class="t0">And should have come again before thee here present,</p>
<p class="t0">Another way, Lord, home they went,</p>
<p class="t0">Contrary to thine honour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then indeed the audience had an opportunity of
watching Herod&rsquo;s rage:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Another way!&rdquo; (he exclaimed, trembling with fury)</p>
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Out! Out! Out!</p>
<p class="t0">Hath those foul traitors done me this deed?</p>
<p class="t0">I stamp, I stare, I look all about;</p>
<p class="t0">Might them I take I should them burn at a glede [fire].</p>
<p class="t0">I rend, I roar, and now run I wood [mad] ...</p>
<p class="t0">They shall be hanged if I come them to.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Roaring and stamping and raving, as he said of
himself, the king rushed down the pageant steps and
&ldquo;raged&rdquo; in the market-place amongst the people, to
the delight of the grown-up folk and the terror of
the children in the crowd. And all the while he
was running to-and-fro, screaming with fury, he was
giving orders that &ldquo;all young children&rdquo; should be
slain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>But even the rough soldiers who had come from the
palace to follow their master, and had at last succeeded
in getting him to return to the stage, were horrified
at this cruel command, and one of them spoke indignantly:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My Lord, King Herod by name,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy words against my will shall be.</p>
<p class="t0">To see so many young children die is shame,</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore counsel thereto gettest thou none of me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Another one agreed with his companion, and warned
Herod that to murder little children in such wholesale
fashion would be sufficient provocation for a general
rising among his subjects.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A rising! Out! Out! Out!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>shouted the mad tyrant; and, raging and stamping
once more, he commanded both soldiers to be hanged
on the gallows unless they immediately carried out his
orders.</p>
<p>So for very fear the soldiers were obliged to obey,
and Herod drove them forth to do the cruel deed,
telling them to bring all the little dead children
&ldquo;before his sight,&rdquo; so that he might be sure his
orders had been carried out.</p>
<p>But now the attention of the audience was directed
towards the other pageant representing the Stable at
Bethlehem. Here the beautiful angel who had already
appeared to the three kings was seen fluttering down
towards the Mother of <span class="sc">Jesus</span> and her husband Joseph,
and soon his voice was heard:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mary and Joseph, to you I say,</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet word from the <span class="sc">Father</span> I bring you full right;</p>
<p class="t0">Out of Bethlehem into Egypt forth go ye the way,</p>
<p class="t0">And with you take the King, full of might,</p>
<p class="t0">For dread of Herod&rsquo;s red [order].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In reply, Joseph turned to Mary:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Arise up, Mary, hastily and soon!</p>
<p class="t0">Our <span class="sc">Lord&rsquo;s</span> will needs must be done,</p>
<p class="t0">Like as the angel bade.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And Mary answered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Meekly, Joseph, mine own spouse,</p>
<p class="t0">Toward that country let us repair;</p>
<p class="t0">In Egypt&mdash;some tokens of house&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God</span> grant us grace safe to come there!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>While she spoke, she was tenderly lifting the
Baby from His cradle, and the curtains closed upon
the Holy Family making preparations for their
journey.</p>
<p>The play now went on in the street, for presently,
threading their way through the crowd, a company of
women entered, each bearing in her arms her little
baby. And as the mothers walked to-and-fro and
rocked their children, they sang this pretty song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lulla, lulla, thou little tiny child;</p>
<p class="t0">By, by, lullay, lullay, thou little tiny child.</p>
<p class="t8">By, by, lully, lullay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O sisters too! how may we do,</p>
<p class="t0">For to preserve this day</p>
<p class="t0">This poor youngling for whom we do sing,</p>
<p class="t8">By, by, lully, lullay.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Herod the king, in his raging,</p>
<p class="t0">Charged he hath this day</p>
<p class="t0">His men of might, in his own sight,</p>
<p class="t0">All young children to slay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That woe is me, poor child, for thee!</p>
<p class="t0">And ever, morn and day,</p>
<p class="t0">For thy parting neither say nor sing,</p>
<p class="t8">By, by, lully, lullay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The poor distracted mothers, with their faces full
of grief, won the pity of the crowd, and many women
exclaimed aloud, half believing that the babies were
really going to be snatched from them and killed!</p>
<p>Then one of the women, in a voice shaken with
fear, sang alone:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I lull my child wondrously sweet,</p>
<p class="t0">And in my arms I do it keep,</p>
<p class="t0">Because that it should not cry.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And another replied, calling on the new-born King:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;That Babe that is born in Bethlehem so meek,</p>
<p class="t0">He save my child and me from villainy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Yet another said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be still! be still! my little child!</p>
<p class="t0">That <span class="sc">Lord</span> of lords save both thee and me;</p>
<p class="t0">For Herod hath sworn with words wild</p>
<p class="t0">That all young children slain they shall be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Now the soldiers come rushing forward with drawn
swords, and though Colin assured her that it was only
pretence, Margery could not look while they grasped
the screaming women by the arms or by the hair and
snatched their little baby-boys away from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>In vain the poor mothers struggled and implored.
Their children were all killed, and presently the
soldiers went away to fetch &ldquo;wains and wagons&rdquo;
on which to heap the little bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are only dolls?&rdquo; Margery asked
anxiously; but though Master Gyseburn reassured
her, she could not bear the sound of the screams and
the shouting.</p>
<p>It was a relief when all the women went sobbing
away, and the herald stood once more before King
Herod, and addressed him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Herod, king! I shall thee tell,</p>
<p class="t0">All thy deeds is come to naught.</p>
<p class="t0">This Child is gone into Egypt to dwell,</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, sir, in thine own land what wonders byn [have been] wrought.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Margery sympathized deeply with the herald&rsquo;s
indignant tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed all the babies, and it was no good
after all!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the wickedest
and the most horrid man I ever saw! Look at
him &lsquo;raging&rsquo; again! What is he going to do
now? See! the servants are getting his horse
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to ride into Egypt to see if he can
find the three kings, to put them to death,&rdquo; said
Master Gyseburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; observed Colin with much satisfaction.
&ldquo;There he goes riding through the crowd,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
still storming. Now he&rsquo;s out of sight&mdash;and a good
thing too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last they saw of Herod was his huge sword
brandished aloft; and the last sound they heard was
his foolish voice raised in anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">IX</span>
<br /><span class="sc">At the End of the Day</span></h2>
<p>The children had been so absorbed and interested in
the last play, which was a long one, that when the
pageant was wheeled away, they were surprised to
find the market-place all glowing in the light of
sunset. Little pink clouds like feathers were floating
in the sky, across which flights of birds were winging
their way to nests in the trees round the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giles will soon be home!&rdquo; said Mistress Harpham.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s time for one more play this
evening I shall be mistaken. It will soon be dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they stop when it gets dark?&rdquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are lots more to come!&rdquo; objected
Colin, looking at the &ldquo;pageant book&rdquo; which Master
Gyseburn held open on his knee. Though he could
not read, he saw by the long list which followed the
<i>Massacre of the Innocents</i> that scarcely half of the
plays had as yet been performed.</p>
<p>Mistress Harpham had turned away to superintend
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
arrangements for the supper she was about to offer
her guests, but Master Gyseburn answered the
children&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plays will go on all day to-morrow, and the
next day too, I expect,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;It very
seldom happens that any town gets through all its
pageants on one day. Certainly not here in York,
where we generally act forty of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose it gets dark in the middle of a
play?&rdquo; asked Margery. &ldquo;What happens then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the torch-bearers are called out,&rdquo; said
Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;I expect they&rsquo;ll be needed
before the next one is over,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The
daylight will scarcely last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll go on to-morrow, and we shan&rsquo;t be
here!&rdquo; sighed Margery, so dolefully that Master
Gyseburn laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not tired of them? And yet you&rsquo;ve had
a long day of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired? Oh! I should love to see every one
of them!&rdquo; Margery declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so should I,&rdquo; echoed her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many sad and dreadful scenes will come
to-morrow,&rdquo; said Master Gyseburn. &ldquo;I really think
you&rsquo;ve seen all that would please you. The others
are for grown-up people. And some are too horrible
for <i>them</i>,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;At least I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now children, come to supper!&rdquo; called Mistress
Harpham, who was busy lighting candles on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
table, for the room with its dark oak-panelling, and
heavy beams overhead, was growing very gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to think about saying good-bye
directly!&rdquo; declared Farmer Short as he took his seat.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a long ride home, and we have to get the
horses out of the stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time for a meal!&rdquo; said Mistress
Harpham, bustling about and filling the children&rsquo;s
plates with good things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Giles come before we have to go?&rdquo; asked
Margery. &ldquo;I do hope he will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as she spoke, the door opened, and Giles
came in.</p>
<p>He was welcomed rapturously by all the guests,
and though the poor boy looked very tired, he was
made to answer a hundred questions about the success
of the Parchment-makers&rsquo; pageant in other parts of
the town.</p>
<p>It had been well received everywhere apparently;
and though Giles was very modest, his mother learnt
with pride that her son&rsquo;s acting had been praised
almost as much as she desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We missed you so much after you went,&rdquo;
whispered Margery to her cousin, a little shyly, for
she was still very much impressed at the thought of
his talents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Master Gyseburn explained everything to
us,&rdquo; put in Colin. &ldquo;And all the plays were
<i>splendid</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Before long there was a general bustle and movement
round the table. Many of the guests, like the
children, had a long way to go to reach their homes,
and they were anxious to set out before the day&rsquo;s
pageants were quite over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a fine crowd in the streets by the time
they&rsquo;re all done,&rdquo; said Master Harpham. &ldquo;But if you
go now, while some of the folk are still looking at the
plays, you&rsquo;ll reach the inn without much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and Robert will go with you and show you
the quickest by-ways to reach it; won&rsquo;t you, Robert?&rdquo;
suggested his wife, as she prepared to follow Mistress
Short and the children to the best bedroom, where
they had left their cloaks.</p>
<p>Colin and Margery were soon ready, and with their
little hoods tied round their necks they returned to
the parlour, and ran eagerly to the window, anxious
up to the last moment to see all that was going on.</p>
<p>They found Giles kneeling on one of the wide
window-seats, looking out into the street, and Margery
climbed up beside him. She had taken a great fancy
to her clever, interesting cousin, and she thought how
pretty he looked with his fair head resting against the
woodwork of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they doing now?&rdquo; she asked before
her own curly head appeared above the level of the
window-sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Child Jesus in the Temple</i>,&rdquo; said Giles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the Spur-makers&rsquo; and Bit-makers&rsquo; pageant, and Andrew
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Martin is the Child <span class="sc">Jesus</span>. He&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the torch-bearers are there!&rdquo; exclaimed
Colin. &ldquo;It <i>has</i> got dark quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look nice in this light?&rdquo; said Margery;
and Giles nodded, too intent upon the play to reply.</p>
<p>At the foot of the pageant, all holding flaming
torches aloft, four boys were stationed, and the ruddy
glow flickered over a beautiful group on the stage.
The learned doctors in their long robes leant upon
one another&rsquo;s shoulders or whispered together, their
eyes fixed upon a youthful figure in their midst, Who
in a grave yet charming voice was reading something
from a roll of parchment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <span class="sc">Jesus</span> when He was a Boy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; whispered
Margery; and again Giles nodded.</p>
<p>The boy wore a long sheepskin coat, and his fair
hair was made brighter by gilding. His legs were
bare, and on his feet were sandals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrew is wonderful!&rdquo; said Giles gravely, &ldquo;all
his gestures are good and dignified. And so is his
voice. This was the part they wanted me to play,
but I would not attempt it. I knew Andrew would
do it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery glanced at her cousin admiringly. In her
little mind she felt sure that Giles too was wonderful,
and that all she had heard about the great things he
was to do in the future had not been exaggerated.
Some day, she was certain, Giles would be a famous
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
man. Her thoughts were put to flight, however, by
the entrance of her mother and a large company of
other guests all ready for departure; so leave-takings
were very hurried.</p>
<p>But she found time to hug Giles, who in spite of
the laughter which went round, allowed himself to be
kissed with very good grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go out by the back way,&rdquo; called Master
Harpham, and the children soon found themselves in
a quiet street, where the noise from the market-place
sounded only as a faint murmur.</p>
<p>By winding lanes and passages Master Harpham led
his guests towards the &ldquo;Dragon&rdquo; inn where they had
left their horses and their wagons. Every now and
then however, when they turned a corner, Margery
and Colin caught a glimpse of a crowd, of flaming
torches, and of the top of one of the pageants
stationed sometimes half-way up a street, sometimes
in a little open space, sometimes beneath a city gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are still going on!&rdquo; Colin exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but only till the pageant of the <i>Doctors in the
Temple</i> has been played at the last halting-place,&rdquo; said
Master Harpham, looking back over his shoulder at
the little boy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over for to-night in our
market-place, for instance; but the Doctors&rsquo; play won&rsquo;t
reach Girdlegate, the last place, for another half-hour,
perhaps.... Now, here&rsquo;s the inn! Hurry, all of
you, and you will get out your horses before there&rsquo;s
too much of a crush.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Dobbin and Jock, looking quite fresh after their
long day&rsquo;s rest, were soon led out from their corner
of the stables, and in a moment Margery was perched
on Dobbin&rsquo;s back, in front of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-nights&rdquo; were called, and, in company with
various other travellers, the children rode along the
cobble-paved streets towards Mikelgate, from which
the pageants had long ago departed, leaving the road
to the gate clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis luck to have moonlight!&rdquo; exclaimed Farmer
Short, as they emerged upon the country-road.</p>
<p>Margery looked back towards the city they had left,
over which hung a dull red glow from the torchlights
which still streamed and flickered there; and as she
looked she drew a long sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s tired!&rdquo; said her mother; but Margery
indignantly denied the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking what a lovely day it&rsquo;s been,&rdquo; she
declared; &ldquo;and about all the plays they will be acting
to-morrow and the next day. But Master Gyseburn
says they will be sad plays. So perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t
like to see them after all. I didn&rsquo;t like it when the
babies were killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a neighbour; &ldquo;there are about twenty
still to come. They&rsquo;ll need two days more at least.
The saddest plays will come last, when the Tapestry-weavers
act the <i>Trial of Christ</i>; and the Tile-makers
and Painters <i>The Crucifixion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mercy it was fine,&rdquo; exclaimed Mistress
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Short. &ldquo;And likely to be fine to-morrow,&rdquo; she added,
with a glance at the clear sky, in which a full moon
sailed.</p>
<p>Both the children grew silent as they jogged towards
home along the white road, upon which fell their
shadows and the shadows of the horses and of overhanging
trees. It was very quiet and peaceful in the
country, and they were both sleepy. All the curious
and novel things they had seen during the day began
to appear like a dream, in which the three kings
passed and re-passed; and Herod, with his flashing
sword, stamped and raved; and beautiful angels, with
golden wings, hovered above a stable in Bethlehem;
and the serpent talked to Adam and Eve. But more
frequently than any of the other figures in the plays
Margery saw the little white-robed Isaac begging for
his life; and, when the cottage was reached at last,
and she was in bed and really asleep, it was of him
she dreamt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">X</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Everyman</span></h2>
<p>As some of you may have noticed, the miracle plays
to which long ago Colin and Margery listened were
for the most part badly written, in such rough, uncouth
verse, that a great deal of each play may be described
as mere doggerel. Very few of them have any claim
to be called <i>literature</i>. They are just rhyming stories,
often very badly rhymed, to be acted before uncritical
people, thousands of whom were poor and simple folk
who, if the stories were sufficiently exciting and the
actors well enough dressed, neither knew nor cared
that the words were poor. Every now and then,
indeed, in these old plays a fragment of verse is
charming. For instance, in the Nativity scene, which
used to be acted at Coventry, there are some delightful
words. Here are a few lines from the prophets&rsquo;
speeches about the new-born King.</p>
<p>Second prophet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yet do I marvel</p>
<p class="t0">In what pile or castle</p>
<p class="t0">These herdsmen did Him see&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>And the first prophet replies:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Neither in halls not yet in bowers,</p>
<p class="t0">Born would He not be,</p>
<p class="t0">Neither in castles nor in towers</p>
<p class="t0">That seemly were to see;</p>
<p class="t0">But at His <span class="sc">Father&rsquo;s</span> will,</p>
<p class="t0">The prophecy to fulfil,</p>
<p class="t0">Betwixt an ox and an ass</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">Jesu</span> this King born He was.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The lullaby to the babies in the same play is pretty
too, and so is the shepherds&rsquo; song when the angels
have announced to them the birth of <span class="sc">Christ</span>. Here
are the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As I out rode this enderes&rsquo; night,</p>
<p class="t0">Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight,</p>
<p class="t0">And all about their fold a star shone bright;</p>
<p class="t0">They sang, Terli, ter low;</p>
<p class="t0">So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the best of all the plays is one that does not
appear in either of the four sets known as the York,
the Coventry, the Chester, and the Wakefield series.
It was probably first written in Dutch, and afterwards
translated into English. For we must remember that
not only in England were these miracle plays acted;
they were just as popular in France, in Germany, and
in Holland, as in our own country. This particular
play is called <i>Everyman</i>, and it is in many ways different
from any of the pageants we have so far talked about.</p>
<p>In the first place, instead of being a Bible story, it is
an allegory, something like the allegory of the
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. Just as Christian, the &ldquo;Pilgrim,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
stands for any human being born into this world and
passing through it on his way to another life, so
Everyman means just what the word says. Every
man or woman of us. <i>Everyone</i>, in fact; since every
one of us is born into this world and, after journeying
through life, has to pass out of it at the gate of
death.</p>
<p>Though the play is so old (it was first written and
acted, perhaps, in the reign of Henry V), it remains
true for people who live nowadays, and for the people
who will live after us. Not only because it is true,
but also because it is so dignified and touching, certain
people who lately read it, thought that it might very
well be acted again, and presented as nearly as possible
in the same way as it was played by actors in bygone
days&mdash;five hundred years ago.</p>
<p>So men and women were found to study it, to learn
the parts, and to copy old dresses for the characters,
and the first revival performance of <i>Everyman</i> was given
in London some years ago, in the open air, at Charterhouse,
the old city school for boys. Since then it has
been acted in many theatres, but perhaps that first
performance was the best of all, because the play, like
all other miracle plays, was meant to be acted out
of doors, and Charterhouse, with its old courtyard and
its old grey walls, was the best frame that could possibly
have been devised for an old play.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of Charterhouse, then, a big wooden
platform or scaffolding was set up, close against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
wall of the school chapel. Steps at either end of the
platform led down to the cobble-paved yard, and on
the wooden stage itself, there were one or two little
recesses, like shrines, hidden by curtains. There was
no other scenery.</p>
<p>Some of the spectators sat on benches in front of the
platform, and all the windows looking into the courtyard
were filled with people, just as the windows
overlooking that market-place in York were crowded,
when miracle plays were acted long ago. And just as
some of those plays began with the coming of a
herald to explain what was going to take place, so this
play of <i>Everyman</i> began with the appearance of a
messenger or <i>doctor</i>. He was dressed in a long black
gown, something like those still worn by the dons and
students at Oxford or Cambridge. Round his neck
was a white ruff, and on his head a flat cap of velvet.
Coming from one of the doorways which opened
into the courtyard, he walked towards the platform,
ascended its steps, and addressed the audience,
beginning with these words.</p>
<p>Messenger:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I pray you all give your audience,</p>
<p class="t0">And hear this matter with reverence,</p>
<p class="t0">By figure a moral play&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">The <i>Summoning of Everyman</i> called it is,</p>
<p class="t0">That to our lives and ending shows</p>
<p class="t0">How transitory we be all day.</p>
<p class="t0">This matter is wondrous precious,</p>
<p class="t0">But the intent of it is more gracious</p>
<p class="t0">And sweet to bear away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Continuing, he reminded his listeners that <i>Everyman</i>
would be required to give an account of his life before
&ldquo;the Heaven King,&rdquo; and he called upon them to listen
to the voice of the Almighty Himself.</p>
<p>His speech ended, he left the platform, and in a
moment, a stately figure representing <span class="sc">God</span> the <span class="sc">Father</span>
appeared at the chapel window which overhung the
stage, in much the same way as five hundred years ago
<span class="sc">God</span> Almighty used to come from a window above the
church porch.</p>
<p>A balcony with a stone balustrade projected from
the window, and leaning upon it the Figure, dressed
as in olden days, like a pope, in costly robe and mitre,
addressed the audience.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I perceive here in My Majesty</p>
<p class="t0">How all creatures are to Me unkind&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>He began in solemn tones&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Living without dread in worldly prosperity;</p>
<p class="t0">Of ghostly sight the people be so blind,</p>
<p class="t0">Drowned in sin they know Me not for their <span class="sc">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He reminded them of the great Sacrifice which
seemed to have passed from their thoughts.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My law that I showed, when I for them died,</p>
<p class="t0">They forget clean, and shedding of My blood red;</p>
<p class="t0">I hanged between two, it cannot be denied;</p>
<p class="t0">To get them life, I suffered to be dead;</p>
<p class="t0">I healed their feet, with thorns hurt was My head;</p>
<p class="t0">I could do no more than I did truly,</p>
<p class="t0">And now I see the people do clean forsake Me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; went on the Almighty, &ldquo;I must bring
Everyman to a reckoning, for he is so cumbered with
worldly riches that he forgets how all riches and
pleasures are only lent to him for a time, and are to be
used for My glory. I will send Death to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where art thou, <i>Death</i>, thou mighty messenger?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He called in grave accents. Then from a door beneath
the stage there came a curious and grotesque creature.</p>
<p>He was like a skeleton; or rather the bones of a
skeleton were painted on his close-fitting dress of black
leather. The mask of a skull was over his face; his
head was crowned with fading roses, and he carried a
drum, upon which he beat with warning blows.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Almighty <span class="sc">God</span>, I am here at your will,</p>
<p class="t0">Your commandment to fulfil&rdquo; (said Death).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Go thou to <i>Everyman</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">And show him in My Name</p>
<p class="t0">A pilgrimage he must on him take,</p>
<p class="t0">Which he in no wise may escape&rdquo; (commanded <span class="sc">God</span> the <span class="sc">Father</span>).</p>
</div>
<p>To whom Death replied that he would run the world
over and search for all who lived &ldquo;out of <span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> laws.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lo, yonder I see <i>Everyman</i> walking! (he exclaimed suddenly)&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Full little he thinketh on my coming.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And indeed it seemed as though the slim and
handsome youth who at that moment came from one
of the houses in the courtyard had never thought
seriously of anything. Careless and light-hearted,
beautifully dressed, and playing on a lute as he walked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
he was thinking only of amusement and gaiety, when,
as he reached the platform, he was suddenly confronted
with Death.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Everyman</i>, stand still! (commanded the mighty messenger).</p>
<p class="t0">Whither art thou going</p>
<p class="t0">Thus gaily? Hast thou thy Master forgot?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At these words poor Everyman trembled and
hesitated, and Death went on to say that he had been
sent to him in great haste &ldquo;from <span class="sc">God</span> out of His
Majesty&rdquo; to tell him he was bidden to take a long
journey and to bring with him his book of reckoning,
to answer before <span class="sc">God</span> for all his deeds in this, his
present life. In vain Everyman begged for a delay.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O <i>Death</i>&rdquo; (he cried), &ldquo;thou comest when I had thee least in mind!</p>
<p class="t0">In thy power it lieth me to save,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet of my good will I give thee, if ye will be kind&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, a thousand pound shalt thou have,</p>
<p class="t0">And defer this matter till another day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But Death replied that &ldquo;to cry, weep, and pray&rdquo;
was of no avail, since he took neither gold, silver, nor
riches from pope, emperor, king, duke, nor princes.
He must instantly set forth on the journey from which
there was no returning.</p>
<p>Then, in his great trouble, Everyman called upon
<span class="sc">God</span>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O gracious <span class="sc">God</span>, in the high seat celestial,</p>
<p class="t0">Have mercy on me in this most need!...</p>
<p class="t0">Shall I have no company from this vale terrestrial?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he asked of Death. For he dreaded to take the long
journey alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yea, if any be so hardy</p>
<p class="t0">That would go with thee and bear thee company,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Death replied.</p>
<p>Then Everyman began to think of his friends, and
to wonder which of them loved him well enough to go
with him into the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
And presently he saw <i>Good Fellowship</i> approaching.
Now in this story &ldquo;Good Fellowship&rdquo; means all the
companions with whom Everyman had spent gay and
delightful hours&mdash;men with whom he had laughed
and jested; men who had professed the greatest affection
for him. So when he saw the smiling face of
Fellowship, he was full of hope, and he went eagerly
to meet him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Everyman</i>, good-morrow by this day (said <i>Fellowship</i>);</p>
<p class="t0">Sir, why lookest thou so piteously?</p>
<p class="t0">If anything be amiss, I pray thee, me say,</p>
<p class="t0">That I may help to remedy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Everyman admitted that he was in great trouble,
and nothing could have been kinder than Fellowship&rsquo;s
voice, as he declared himself ready to do anything for
his friend. If any one had wronged him, he was ready
to kill the offender. That he would never forsake his
dear companion Everyman might rest assured.</p>
<p>So, greatly consoled, Everyman told him that he
must take a long journey, and he begged that Fellowship
would be his travelling companion. Then, for
the first time, the gay and cheerful fellow began to
look serious. &ldquo;I promised not to forsake you,&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
said; &ldquo;but we must discuss the matter at greater
length. If we took such a journey, when should we
come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, never again till the day of doom,&rdquo; answered
Everyman sadly.</p>
<p>At these words Fellowship started back in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who hath you these tidings brought?&rdquo; he asked
in a strange voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Death was with me here,&rdquo; Everyman
replied.</p>
<p>Then Fellowship, more than ever afraid, absolutely
refused to go on a journey commanded by Death. If
Everyman had wanted him to eat and drink with him,
or to help him in any of his pleasures, he would never
have forsaken him, he declared. Even if he had
wanted him to commit murder he would have been
ready to serve him. But this request was an impossible
one, so impossible that he would not even accompany
him as far as the town gates.</p>
<p>So, very mournfully, Everyman wished him farewell,
gazing after him as he hurried away, a brilliant
figure in his scarlet doublet and hose, with his sword
clanking at his side.</p>
<p>Good Fellowship had failed him; &ldquo;but surely,&rdquo;
thought Everyman, &ldquo;my own relations will be faithful
to me in my sorrow?&rdquo; And when he saw them
strolling across the courtyard, hope once more revived
in his heart.</p>
<p>Of the little company of young men who now came
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
on to the platform, one was Everyman&rsquo;s cousin, of
whom he was very fond; and this cousin, seeing that
something was wrong, begged for an explanation,
which, in these words, Everyman gave:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Gramercy, my friends and kinsmen kind,</p>
<p class="t0">Now shall I show you the grief of my mind:</p>
<p class="t0">I was commanded by a messenger,</p>
<p class="t0">That is an high King&rsquo;s chief officer;</p>
<p class="t0">He bade me go a pilgrimage, to my pain,</p>
<p class="t0">And I know well I shall never come again;</p>
<p class="t0">Also I must give a reckoning straight,</p>
<p class="t0">For I have a great enemy that lieth me in wait,</p>
<p class="t0">Which intendeth me for to hinder.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Now, as he spoke, the faces of the young men grew
very grave and anxious.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What account is that which ye must render?</p>
<p class="t0">That would I know,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>demanded one of them.</p>
<p>And Everyman replied:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of all my works I must show</p>
<p class="t0">How I have lived and my days spent;</p>
<p class="t0">Also of ill deeds that I have used</p>
<p class="t0">In my time, sith life was me lent;</p>
<p class="t0">And of all virtues that I have refused.</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore I pray you go thither with me</p>
<p class="t0">To help to make mine account, for Saint Charity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the kinsmen started back in horror.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nay, Everyman, I had liefer fast bread and water</p>
<p class="t0">All this five year and more!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>exclaimed one of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>And the cousin said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have the cramp in my toe. Trust not to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One by one they hastened away, and poor Everyman
was left lamenting, till suddenly a thought struck
him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All my life I have loved riches&rdquo; (he reflected);</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If that my Good [wealth] now help me might,</p>
<p class="t0">He would make my heart full light.</p>
<p class="t0">I will speak to him in this distress.</p>
<p class="t0">Where art thou, my <i>Goods</i> and riches?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>No sooner had he called, than the curtains before
one of the recesses on the stage slid back, and disclosed
a man richly dressed, seated within. Before
him money-bags were piled, and huge chests containing
gold and precious stones.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who calleth me?&rdquo; (said <i>Goods</i>). &ldquo;Everyman? What haste thou hast!...</p>
<p class="t0">What would ye have, lightly me say.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So Everyman began to relate his trouble, while
<i>Goods</i> gazed at him with his cold inhuman eyes.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Therefore, I pray thee, go with me,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>concluded Everyman, falteringly;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For, peradventure, thou may&rsquo;st before <span class="sc">God</span> Almighty</p>
<p class="t0">My reckoning help to clean and purify;</p>
<p class="t0">For it is said ever among</p>
<p class="t0">That money maketh all right that is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nay, Everyman, I sing another song;</p>
<p class="t0">I follow no man in such voyages,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>declared <i>Goods</i>; and, when Everyman spoke to him
indignantly,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What, weenest [imaginest] thou that I am thine?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I had wend [imagined] so,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>stammered Everyman.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nay, Everyman; I say no!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>returned Goods; and went on to assure him that
<i>Goods</i> were only lent, and that they generally killed
a man&rsquo;s soul. Then, in his great despair, Everyman
cursed the cruel spirit, who only laughed mockingly,
refused to follow him out of this world, and before
Everyman could speak again drew close the curtains
of his shrine.</p>
<p>Once more he strove to think of some help, and, at
last, he recalled <i>Good Deeds</i>, only to remember that
she was so weak that she could &ldquo;neither go nor
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet will I venture on her now,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My <i>Good Deeds</i>, where be you?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Again, at the other end of the stage, a recess opened,
and there, lying on the ground, so feeble and starved
that she could scarcely move, was a beautiful woman
dressed in a long white robe embroidered with stars.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here I lie cold in the ground (she said faintly).</p>
<p class="t0">Thy sins hath me sore bound,</p>
<p class="t0">That I cannot stir.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Very humbly Everyman approached her, for he
knew that it was through his fault that she was so
weak and ill. He had neglected and scorned her, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
now she seemed his only hope, and so he implored her
to take the journey with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would full fain, but I cannot stand verily,&rdquo; she
declared. And then she showed him how his &ldquo;book
of accounts,&rdquo; in which his good deeds should have
been numbered, was almost empty, and the pages
were so blurred and the letters so confused that
Everyman could not decipher them. He was almost
beside himself with grief and fear, when Good Deeds
advised him to seek counsel of her sister, who was
called <i>Knowledge</i>, for she possibly might help him
&ldquo;to make that dreadful reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Everyman stood before her shrine, and, when
the curtains parted, he saw that Knowledge was grave,
and beautiful, and kind.</p>
<p>To his great joy she promised to be his guide; but
before all things she told him he must first seek
<i>Confession</i>, who would cleanse him from his sins.</p>
<p>So Knowledge brought him to Confession, a stately
figure in a monk&rsquo;s cowl. Confession stepped from
his shrine to counsel and instruct poor Everyman,
who confessed his sins, and begged that Good Deeds
might be strengthened.</p>
<p>Kneeling before Confession, he prayed earnestly to
<span class="sc">God</span>, and presently Good Deeds stood at his side.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I thank <span class="sc">God</span>, now I can walk and go;</p>
<p class="t0">And am delivered of my sickness and woe (she said).</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore with Everyman I will go, and not spare.</p>
<p class="t0">His good works I will help him to declare.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>With an encouraging smile, Knowledge bade the
penitent Everyman be of good cheer; and, with these
words, she gave him a robe, which she told him to
wear.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It is (she said) a garment of sorrow:</p>
<p class="t0">From pain it will you borrow;</p>
<p class="t0">Contrition it is</p>
<p class="t0">That getteth forgiveness;</p>
<p class="t0">It pleaseth <span class="sc">God</span> passing well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So Everyman put on the sad-coloured robe, and
was preparing to set forward on his journey with the
two beautiful women, when Good Deeds told him
that three other people must go with them, their names
being <i>Discretion</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Beauty</i>.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Also (said Knowledge), ye must call to mind</p>
<p class="t0">Your five wits [five senses] as for your counsellors.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So Everyman called aloud, and Discretion, Strength,
Beauty, and the Five Senses (or wits), one after
another, came towards him. They were all splendid
and stately figures, and the <i>Five Wits</i> were five
beautiful women dressed in rainbow-coloured garments.</p>
<p>Then Good Deeds addressed them, praying them
all to accompany Everyman on his last long journey,
and each one in turn promised faithfully never to
forsake him.</p>
<p>It seemed, therefore, as though the poor traveller
had many friends with him after all, and when
Knowledge advised him to go to a priest and take
the Holy Sacrament, he consented gladly and humbly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>On his return, Everyman found his companions
waiting for him, but suddenly he felt so weak that
he knew he was almost at the end of that journey
commanded by Death.</p>
<p>In the courtyard below the platform, at some
distance, there was an open grave; and looking at it
he said to Beauty:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Friends, let us not turn again to this land,</p>
<p class="t0">Not for all the world&rsquo;s gold;</p>
<p class="t0">For into this cave must I creep</p>
<p class="t0">And turn to earth, and then to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What! into this grave? Alas! (exclaimed Beauty)</p>
<p class="t0">And what&mdash;should I smother here?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yes, by my faith (said Everyman), and never more appear;</p>
<p class="t0">In this world live no more we shall,</p>
<p class="t0">But in heaven, before the highest <span class="sc">Lord</span> of all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, full of fear, Beauty declined to go with
Everyman.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Peace, I am deaf; I look not behind me;</p>
<p class="t0">Not and thou would give me all the gold in thy chest,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she exclaimed; and turning from him in spite of her
promise, she hurried away.</p>
<p>Strength followed, crying:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thy game liketh me not at all!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And, after him, fled Discretion, saying:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When Strength goeth before, I follow after evermore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Deserted by these three friends, Everyman, who
had descended the steps of the stage, was now quite
close to the grave, and the scene was very solemn
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
and impressive. Evening was drawing near. Long
shadows were cast upon the courtyard, and across
the sky, still clear, but rosy with sunset, flights of
birds moved slowly. The last rays of the sun touched
the roofs of the old grey houses, and the bells from
the city churches near were chiming together.</p>
<p>One by one the beautiful figures who had forsaken
him crossed the courtyard and filed back to the
world, across the stage, while Everyman, in his black
robe of sorrow, attended only by <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Good
Deeds</i>, stood at the brink of the tomb.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, all things faileth save <span class="sc">God</span> alone! (he cried)</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Beauty</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i>;</p>
<p class="t0">For when <i>Death</i> bloweth his blast,</p>
<p class="t0">They all run from me full fast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And now the <i>Five Senses</i>, who had come near to
the tomb and formed a shining group round it, also
one by one turned away; and, in a failing voice,
Everyman murmured:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O <span class="sc">Jesus</span>, help! all hath forsaken me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But <i>Good Deeds</i>, with a sweet smile, drew close
to him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nay, Everyman&rdquo; (she said), &ldquo;I will bide with thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I will not forsake thee indeed;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou shalt find me a good friend at need.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus Everyman found that though he had loved
all his other friends better than <i>Good Deeds</i>, she alone
was faithful, for even <i>Knowledge</i>, who had so far
followed him, now sadly moved aside, and he knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
the truth of the words uttered at the very edge of
the grave by <i>Good Deeds</i>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All earthly things is but vanity:</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Beauty</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i> do man forsake;</p>
<p class="t0">Foolish friends and kinsmen that fair spake,</p>
<p class="t0">All fleeth save <i>Good Deeds</i>, and that am I.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Right into the grave she followed Everyman, and
when, as he was sinking back, he cried:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Have mercy on me, <span class="sc">God</span> most mighty;</p>
<p class="t0">And stand by me, thou Mother and Maid, holy Mary!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she answered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fear not, I will speak for thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And when the grave covered both of them, <i>Knowledge</i>
came near, and bending over it, said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now hath he suffered that we all shall endure;</p>
<p class="t0">The <i>Good Deeds</i> shall make all sure.</p>
<p class="t0">Now hath he made an ending.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She paused, listening, and in a joyful voice added:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Methinketh that I hear angels sing,</p>
<p class="t0">And make great joy and melody,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Everyman&rsquo;s soul received shall be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And indeed, almost before <i>Knowledge</i> had finished
speaking, there appeared on the balcony, high above
the stage, an angel with long wings of rose-colour;
and, while sweet music sounded, the angel spoke:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, excellent elect spouse, to <span class="sc">Jesu</span>:...</p>
<p class="t0">Thy reckoning is crystal-clear;</p>
<p class="t0">Now shalt thou into the heavenly sphere,</p>
<p class="t0">Unto the which ye all shall come</p>
<p class="t0">That liveth well, before the day of doom.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>So, though the play had been very sad, it ended
with beautiful sights and sounds, and before the
people in the audience moved, the Messenger stood
once more alone upon the stage, warning them to
bear the moral of Everyman in mind:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forsake pride (he said), for he deceiveth you in the end;</p>
<p class="t0">And remember <i>Beauty</i>, <i>Five Wits</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i>:</p>
<p class="t0">They all at the last do Everyman forsake,</p>
<p class="t0">Save his <i>Good Deeds</i>, there doth he take.</p>
<p class="t0">But beware, and they be small</p>
<p class="t0">Before <span class="sc">God</span> he hath no help at all....</p>
<p class="t0">For after death amends may no man make.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But though this simple and beautiful old play is
sometimes acted nowadays, and though many people
are interested and touched whenever it is performed,
yet, at any rate in England, the time for miracle plays
has gone by.</p>
<p>If not wiser, the world has at least grown older
since the days when crowds of simple and unlearned
folk assembled in market-places, or on village-greens,
to be taught the Bible history which they can now
read for themselves.</p>
<p>A few men and women, it is true, occasionally write
religious plays even now. There is one, for instance,
called <i>Bethlehem</i>, written by Laurence Housman,
which has lately been acted several times, and another
by Miss Buckland, with the title of <i>Eager Heart</i>, has
for six years been played every Christmas in the big
hall at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>But these modern religious dramas are like late
violets blooming when the real violet time is over.
It may be delightful to find them still growing here
and there, but just as some flowers belong to the
spring and cannot live into the summer, so the real
miracle plays which flourished in the spring-time of
our country&rsquo;s history have died away now that the
country&rsquo;s life is older.</p>
<p>There is in Europe at the present day only one
important religious play to which, as in olden times,
thousands of people flock, and that is called the Ober
Ammergau Passion Play, and is given once in ten
years.</p>
<p>Ober Ammergau is a village in Bavaria, and the
play, acted by the villagers, deals with the last days of
<span class="sc">Christ</span> on earth, and is so wonderful and so beautiful
that it has become very celebrated.</p>
<p>In a far-away German village like Ober Ammergau,
where the natives are simple folk living apart from
the great world, such a performance as this is still
possible, and still a beautiful thing. Nevertheless it
remains true that for the great mass of people the age
of miracle plays is over.</p>
<p>But though as national events they have passed away
from our country for ever, we must not forget that
quite apart from the work of teaching which they once
performed, they are very important in the history of
our literature.</p>
<p>Rough and often badly written as they are, these
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
miracle plays prepared the way for the drama which
was to follow them in the days of Queen Elizabeth.
It is not too much to say that without them we might
never have had <i>Hamlet</i>, nor <i>As you like it</i>, nor any of
the splendid and beautiful plays of such a great
dramatist as William Shakespeare.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
